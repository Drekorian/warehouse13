00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,080
V minulých dílech Warehouse 13...

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,790
Claudia Donovanová, Warehouse 13: Nová generace.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,520
Nechceš se raději bavit s lidmi svého věku?

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,020
Artie, já mám svůj vlastní věk.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,250
Tohle místo je můj domov.

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,220
Macpherson směřuje k Saint-Catherine!

7
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,550
Chci to, pro co jste riskovali životy.

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,440
Můžu Macpherson znova dostat.

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,230
O tom nepochybuji.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,860
Tys šel po mé rodině.

11
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:27,180
To začal Arthur.

12
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,840	
Co to má znamenat?

13
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,440
Zeptej se jeho.

14
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,330
PŘED 15 LETY

15
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,630
Přestaň mi omílat skladištní dogma, Arthure!

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,830
Život ženy je v sázce.

17
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,310
Mnoho životů je v sázce!

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,110
- A dal jsi slib. - Miluju ji.

19
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,570
Budu ji zachránit.

20
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,540
Miluješ jí.

21
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,010
Vím, že ji miluješ taky.

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,440
Takže víš jak bolestivé to pro mě je.

23
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,390
Můžeš jí zachránit život!

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,780
A co následky?

25
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,080
Ona žije, ostatní lidé umírají!

26
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,330
Chceš s tímhle žít?

27
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,510
Nemůžeš si hrát na Boha.

28
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,500
No, ale ani vy.

29
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,460
Ani ty, ani Fyzici, ani Regenti.

30
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,800
Arthure, oni akorát sedí a hromadí si věci, které můžou zachránit svět.

31
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,040
Pomůžeme jim.

32
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,840
No, teď už ne.

33
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,580
Dokončil jsem to.

34
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,180
Dej mi to!

35
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,160
Ne.

36
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,780
Ne! Nemůžu.

37
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,520
Arthure...

38
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,320
Arthure.

39
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,770
Pět hasičů zemřelo v noci

40
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,620
Pouze žena přežila.

41
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,150
Kdo to je?

42
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,440
Carol Augustine.

43
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,830
Žije v D.C.

44
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,370
Momentálně sama, alespoň pokud víme.

45
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,880
A ona byla Macphersonova žena?

46
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,020
Ano.

47
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,700
Dostali někdy to vraždícího zkur...?

48
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,230
MacPherson dostal pět po sobě jdoucích doživotí

49
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,880
a byl vypovězen ze Skladiště.

50
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,730	
Tak samozřejmě MacPherson utekl.

51
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,640
Poté, co sloužil dva roky ve vězení,

52
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:52,020
tam došlo k nevysvětlitelné explozi.

53
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,550
Desítky byly zabity.

54
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,910	
Bylo nám řečeno, že MacPherson byl mezi nimi.

55
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,700
Byli jsme špatně informováni.

56
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,440	
Pak se objeví na japonské ambasádě v D.C.

57
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,430
Od té toby jsme Carol sledovali.

58
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,830	
Sledovala jsem jeho pohyby v D.C.,

59
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,790
ani jednou ji nekontaktoval.

60
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,640	
Ne, místo toho šel po mé rodině.

61
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:16,920
Nemohu pochopit, proč jím je Artie posedlý.

62
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,700
No, tenhle chlap nemá žádný problém zabít kohokoliv, co?

63
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,220
Dobře si to zapamatujte, až po něm půjdete.

64
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,720
No tak.

65
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,410
Jak se vlastně dá ze Skladiště někoho vypovědět?

66
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,880
Zní jako Romeo a Julie.

67
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,540
Ne, ne, ne, nic na tom není romantické.

68
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,970
Zdi Skladiště jsou napuštěny

69
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,060
velice vzácným nerostem jménem painit.

70
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,020
A než byl MacPherson uvězněn,

71
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,090
tak mu byla trvale vpíchnuta substance,

72
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,360
která dramaticky reaguje, pokud je v blízkosti tohoto painitu.

73
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,850
Dramaticky?

74
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,020
Mohl byste být trošku konkrétnější s modifikátory?

75
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,440
Mohl.

76
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,290
Pokud by MacPherson dorazil do Skladiště,

77
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,750
jeho krev by se změnila v kyselinu.

78
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,340
A okamžitě prožrala jeho žílami.

79
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,110
Ty vole...

80
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,260
Vskutku.

81
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,140
Kde jste, mimochodem?

82
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,980
Už jsem prošel Blízský Východ, mířím do Afriky - já ho najdu.

83
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,100
- Jo? - Je to moje práce.

84
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,930
No, možná jsi našla sobě rovného co se týče

85
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,600
hackování do MacPhersonova...

86
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,970
No jasně. Kdo je tady borec?

87
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,910
FIX_ME You got a nibble?

88
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,810
- Žvýkat. - Co?

89
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,110
Pero Edgara Allana Poea.

90
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,000
Na prodej.

91
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,630
No Podívám se. Pardon.

92
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,870
"Pro prohlédnutí zbytku této elitní sbírky...

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,950
Proč by prodával artefakty - leda... Ne!

95
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,240
Neklikej na to!

96
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,350
No, já vždycky neznámé stránky projedu antivirem, než na ně vstoupím.

97
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,590
- To je dobrý nápad. - No jo...

98
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,990
Ach, ne. Ne, ne, ne, ne, ne.

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,620
Nesmíte vypnout Claudio-metr.

100
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,720
Je mi to hrozně, hrozně líto.

101
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,210
Tak to chodí v kybersvětě.

102
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,640	
Budeme potřebovat chvilku.

103
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,170
- Víš, mohla bys zkusit... - Sáhni na to a zemřeš!

104
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,780
WASHINGTON, DC

105
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,660
Děkuji vám za trpělivost, pane.

106
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:07,020
Pane Freitagu, mám pocit, že toto by vás mohlo obzvláště zajímat.

107
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,170
Co to přesně dělá, pane MacPhersone?

108
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,530
Přejeďte prsty přes okraj.

109
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,590
Bože.

110
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,240
Považujte to za dárek.

111
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,670
Ukázku toho, co přijde.

112
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,870
Pane MacPherone, jaké další artefakty budou na prodej?

113
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,680
Pane Paku, jak se zdá, tak už jste v osidlech chamtivosti.

114
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,220
No, další artefakty jsou sbírány zatímco spolu mluvíme.

115
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,730
Ale zatím, pohleďte na Fénixe!

116
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:43,740
Je to důvod, proč jsme tady v mé továrně - tato ukázka?

117
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,390
Jste velmi vnímavý, pane Freitagu.

118
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,870
Ano, nemyslel jsem, že tak opatrní gentlemanové,

119
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,530
jako vy by by utratili takové peníze za povídačku nebo legendu.

120
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,640
To máte pravdu.

121
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,440
Carsone, mohl bys to na moment podržet?

122
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,850
Děkuji.

123
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,460
Co to děláte, člověče?

124
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,700
Pokat! Stát!

125
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,810
On tam zemře.

126
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,050
Trpělivost!

127
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,200
Trpělivost.

128
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,320
Trpělivost.

129
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,640
Ano. Tady.

130
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,240
Jak vidíte, ve správných rukou může toto být vyjímečně užitečné.

131
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,760
Co je to?

132
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,650
Co je s nimi?

133
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,890

FIX_ME Nevýznamné collateral damage.

136
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,970
Ale vhodné pro předvedení.

137
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,150
Pane MacPherone, zastavte to.

138
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,020
Nedá se to zastavit.

139
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,990
Za každý život, který Fénix zachrání, budou jiné zmařeny.

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,960
Ti, kdo se dotknou Fénixe, budou ušetřeni.

141
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,360
Ale ostatní mají méně štěstí.

142
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,840
A toto si dovlujete v mojí továrně?

143
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,300
Prostá ukázka, pane Freitagu.

144
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,660
Pokud na ni nemáte žaludek,

145
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,340
tak pro vás Fénix asi neí to pravé.

146
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,920
Pánové...

147
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,200
Umíte si představit tento nástroj v rukách jednoho z vašich patriotů?

Odhodlání sebevražedného atentátníka, který nikdy nezemřeThe commitment of a suicide bomber who never,ever dies.

Žádný strach, já nás nahodím zpátky.

No to je paráda.

00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,840
Trochu důvěry, prosím.

162
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,450
Proč prodává to pero?

163
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,810
Chci říct, bůhví, co dalšího ještě má.

164
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,690
O co mu jde?

165
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,350
FIX_ME Okay,let's go overwhat we don't know.

166
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,070
To by mohlo trvat týdny.

167
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,870
- Měsíce. - Roky.

168
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,280
Hele, Artie, musels na něco zapomenout.

169
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,650
Znáš MacPhersona líp než kdokoli jiný.

170
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,220
Musí být nějaký malý detail, který jsi přehlídnul.

171
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,820
Jo, něco nepodstatného.

172
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,220
Kontak, který mohl použít.

173
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,110
Oblíbené místo.

174
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,380
Příbuzného.

175
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,610
Prostě...

176
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,010
A vy dva jako co? Vyslýcháte mě?

177
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,650
Vyšetřují.

178
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,200
Na to jsme je najali. Nebo snad ne?

179
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,190
No a co Carol?

180
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,220
Jak víte o Carol?

181
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,070
Cos to... Co... Vy jste jim to řekla?

182
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,090
Všechno?

183
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,400
No jistěže řekla.

184
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,010
Jistěže řekla.

185
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,400
FIX_ME No wonder I'm gettingthe third degree.

186
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,030
Napadlo vás se mě třeba zeptat, než jste to vybreptala?

187
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,510
Agente Nielsene!

188
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,620
Zapomínáte, s kým mluvíte.

189
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,760
Arthure, nikdo neví, čeho je schopný lépe, než ty.

190
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,510
Možná kromě mě.

191
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:19,570
Agenti Berongová a Lattimer budou potřebovat vědět všechno, pokud mají mít šanci na přežití.

192
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,610
Všechno.

193
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,120
Jo. Omlouvám se. Máte pravdu.

194
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,020
Já jsem hlavně nikdy neměl Carolyn navštívit.

195
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,380
Když MacPherson jel do D.C.

196
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,980
a ty roky prostě převrátily jeho myšlení.

197
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,970
Já jen nevím, jestli jsem neohrozil její život.

198
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,560
Vy tři si s ní musíte promluvit.

199
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,340
Ne. Ne, ne, ne.

200
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,390
Už jsem se na ní zaměřil i tak dost.

201
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,450
You've got no choice,arthur.

202
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,650
She's our only lead.

203
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,450
Dude Don't sweat it.

204
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,320
I'll cover it from here.

205
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,100
After being magnetizedto the ceiling and nearly ground upin the gooery,

206
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,140
I think I'm prepped.What?

207
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,240
Why are you shakingyour jowls at me?

208
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,090
You should all get going.

209
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,730
I'll stay with claudia,

210
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,720
and she will brief meon those two events.

211
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,140
No matter what he said,you're not safe.

212
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,240
I haven't seen james macphersonin 15 years.

213
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,050
I never even visited himin prison.

214
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,870
Well,that's hard to believesince he saved your life.

215
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,130
Others died that nightin my place.

216
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,060
I wouldn't have madethat choice.

217
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,490
And I have never forgiven jamesfor making it for me.

218
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,360
Artie knows that.

219
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,990
You like fresh-cut flowers.

220
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,470
- I beg your pardon. - They're all aroundthe apartment.

221
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,210
Well,as you said,I like them.

222
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,770
There's a jewelry box in the trash with some wrapping paper.

223
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,500
- I had a birthday. - Your birthday'sin four months.

224
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,230
We're very good at the google.

225
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,710
There's two umbrellasbehind me.

226
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,440
One's pink,one's black.

227
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,760
- Was it raining three days ago? - I think it was.

228
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,960
He's not the manyou think he is.

229
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,230
- he's changed. - Carol...carol...

230
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,350
Listen to me.

231
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,120
I would like to protect you from whatever the hell it ishe's planning to do.

232
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:01,380
God,you know,you come barging in here disrupting my life.

233
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,300
He's only been herea few times.

234
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,150
When was the last?

235
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,240
Three days ago.

236
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,470
Oh,well,it's easy to understand how you would haveforgotten that.

237
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,120
What's this?

238
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,000
- I have no idea. - Let me see that.

239
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,000
This is an egyptian symbol.

240
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,920
It's a was scepter.

241
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,350
It represents power.

242
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,070
The deities used tocarry this around as

243
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,070
a sign of their controlover the forces of chaos.

244
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,250
It's funny...

245
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,030
it's the same as the pendant you're wearingaround your neck.

246
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,230
Oh,let me see that.

247
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,010
That's very nice.

248
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,270
- It's from james? - Yes.

249
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,820
You know I haveto ask you for it,carol.

250
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,070
Amazing.

251
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,560
You think working insome magical storage unit gives you the rightto do as you please?

252
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,610
Stop protecting him.

253
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:57,070
I never could decide,does mrs.Frederic hirearrogant people,

254
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,670
or do you just get arrogantby working there?

255
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,210
- What is it? - I got a really bad feeling.

256
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,580
About what?

257
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,320
Well,I think it's about...artie.

258
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,120
I think--I think he's gonna-

259
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,300
never mind.It's gone now.

260
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,520
6166 broadview.

261
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,870
Ironically,the warehouse district.

262
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,510
We are up and running.

263
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,920
Taking her to warp speed,captain.

264
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,990
Okay,do you think you canhack into macpherson's site?

265
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,930
Well,yeah,duh.But major fire-wallage.

266
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,860
I mean,you get past one,

267
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,250
and there's another one set up right at-

268
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,100
claudia.Claudia,what's wrong?

269
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,820
Who's that?

270
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,380
That's him.

271
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,170
That-that's james macpherson?

272
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:44,820
Claudia...

273
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,180
leena...

274
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,820
I know him.

275
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,470
How?

276
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,540
He was joshua'sphysics professor.

277
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,220
I mean,I was just a kid,but I remember that face.

278
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,420
He was the one who gave joshuarheticus's compass.

279
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,370
He contacted me.

280
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,130
What?When?

281
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:02,810
Eight months ago.

282
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,280
I was tracking artie,trying to find this place,and I hit a snag.

283
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,170
And out of the blue I hear fromprofessor reynolds,right.

284
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,170
He "friends" me.We email back and forth.

285
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,320
"How's joshua?"Blah blah blah.

286
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,160
I fill him in,tell him about my project,

287
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,670
and he suggests a few waysaround the firewall.

288
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,830
The warehouse firewall?

289
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,400
Leena,I thinkjames macpherson helped me hack into the warehouse.

290
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,980
Tool and die factory?

291
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,810
Why tool and die.

292
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,240
What is he doing?

293
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,160
I don't know,maybehe's got a new career.

294
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,180
He doesn't exactly strike meas the blue-collar type.

295
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,440
All right,this is-this is a german machine,I think.

296
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,840
I think they all are.

297
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,150
- Why would he go to the trouble - can I help you?

298
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,250
We're not opento the public.

299
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,940
We're looking forjames macpherson.

300
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,130
There's no one hereby that name.

301
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,890
Do you know him?

302
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,130
Who are you?

303
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,550
Secret service.

304
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,000
We're gonna need to look around.

305
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,480
Yes,well,by all meansmake yourself at home.

306
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,000
What are you doing?

307
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,370
Close your eyes.

308
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,390
Okay.

309
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,470
All right.

310
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,990
Just close your eyes.

311
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,520
There.You can hear me?

312
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,210
- Oh!Yeah. - Yes?All right.

313
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,270
- Okay? - Okay.

314
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,910
Artie,what was that?

315
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,990
That was the gobletof severan.

316
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,980
A goblet of severanbecause,obviously,the goblet's in the warehouse,

317
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,150
so there must have beenanother one that survived.

318
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,290
Well,I bet I can guesswhat it does.

319
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,550
Pete,put this glassin your pocket.

320
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:49,800
This--this-this was designedby a roman glass blower in 221

321
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,360
for the emperor elagabalus,who was a ridiculouslyincompetent young man.

322
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,210
The only way he couldget a room quiet was by using this thing.

323
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,030
It emitteda high-pitched sound and brought everyoneto their knees.

324
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,210
I could've used one of thosein high school.

325
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:01,930
Indeed.

326
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,320
All right,so just,

327
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,400
um-artie,this has thategyptian symbol on it.

328
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,400
- The was scepter. - Yes.

329
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,540
Maybe carol'S...

330
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,120
like...

331
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,500
this.

332
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,850
And now it...

333
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,010
opens.

334
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,500
Always interesting.

335
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,520
Hold this.

336
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,310
- The phoenix. - What?

337
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,820
- It's the phoenix. - Wait,wait.

338
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,190
Let me see,let me see.

339
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,240
I look great in glasses.

340
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,180
Oh,my--that is amazing!

341
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,880
What?What is that?

342
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,770
"Starting bid $20 million"?

343
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,000
- It says that? - Yeah,it's like a catalog.

344
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,020
But the phoenix isin the warehouse.

345
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,680
He's selling it?

346
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,190
20 million,and that's just the starter.

347
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,730
No,he can't have it.It's in the warehouse.

348
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,560
That doesn't make any sense.

349
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,240
Why would he sell it?

350
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,650
I mean,he's not doing thisfor the money.

351
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,840
Yeah,what kind of a villainwould he be?

352
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,040
Listen to me.

353
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,760
The phoenix is in the warehouse.

354
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,970
He doesn't have it.

355
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,270
Well--but even if he didhave it,right,

356
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,390
he's not doing thisfor the money.

357
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,370
No,he's not doing itfor the money.

358
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,880
He's doing itfor another reason.I just don't know what.

359
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,260
Here,check it.

360
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,850
This is too easy.

361
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,920
He wants us to findthese things.

362
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:29,770
Exactly,which is what'smaking me very,very nervous about following this lead.

363
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,530
And making me very nervous...

364
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,270
about dragging the two of youwith me.

365
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,600
- Don't even worry about that. - No,no,no.

366
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,210
All right,fine.

367
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,990
Yes,obviously it's a trapof some sort.

368
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,780
But he would knowthat I know it's a trap.

369
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,220
So what is he planning,knowing that I know he knows?

370
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:55,300
Guys,this-this has the date,time,and address of the auction,and...

371
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:58,140
it's today.

372
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,640
The auction is today.

373
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,890
Is she certain?

374
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,570
She claims that macphersonwas posing as joshua's professor.

375
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,600
That's how he madehis initial contact.

376
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,510
She's very upset.

377
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,450
Where is she now?

378
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,210
At the b'n'B.

379
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,580
Your bodyguard's keepingan eye on her.

380
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,230
What is it?

381
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,520
I've just always felt thatshe was out of tune.

382
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,080
Something hovering.

383
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,540
I just could nevertell what,exactly.

384
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,940
This is troubling.

385
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,230
Do you think that he couldstill be using her somehow?

386
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,960
Yes.

387
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,130
Macpherson claimsto have the phoenix.

388
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,400
The phoenix isin the warehouse.

389
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,150
I know.

390
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,750
I'll get back to you.

391
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,900
Now I'm getting angry.

392
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,240
When I told himthe phoenix was gone,

393
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,380
he was genuinely surprisedand distraught.

394
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,930
Then he told me aboutthe goblet of severan.

395
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,500
Well,here it is.

396
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,210
Safe and sound.

397
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,250
Open it,please.

398
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,460
Okay.

399
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,150
That's not possible.

400
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,660
- He can't possibly have accessto warehouse things unless - yes.

401
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,540
These new video displaysrecord access,do they not?

402
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,400
Hang on.

403
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,680
There's my access,which was a few moments ago.

404
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,220
Let me just toggle backto see the last person...

405
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,210
macpherson certainly knowshow to pick his spots.

406
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,070
- This is frederic. - Go ahead,I'll catch up.

407
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,710
I feel like custer walkinginto little big horn.

408
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,110
If he wanted us dead,he's had several opportunities.

409
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,880
This--this is aboutsomething else.

410
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,360
All right,well,what?

411
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,240
This is the place.

412
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,120
This is the time.

413
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,650
There's nothing here.

414
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,140
Hey,guys,the phoenixand the goblet of severan...

415
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,140
mrs.Frederic says it's beentaken from the warehouse.

416
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,430
And she seemed shaken.

417
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,040
- Mrs.Frederic? - Yeah.

418
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,640
- Seemed shaken? - Yeah.

419
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,350
That is so not comforting.

420
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,230
Oh,great,great.

421
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,540
So what do we do now?

422
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,180
Just wait for macphersonto drop a net on us?

423
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,350
If he's ahead of usand we can't see him,

424
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,070
then we're gonna have tofollow

425
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,920
the trail he leaves until we can see him.

426
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,670
And we watcheach other's backs.

427
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,710
What?

428
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,990
- Good afternoon.
- Nothing.Nothing.

429
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,330
Do you see that?

430
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,680
Did--did the
boycause this?

431
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,060
Artie,artie,you still got those glasses?

432
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,330
Good idea.

433
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:43,460
You know...

434
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:53,270
oh,I thought I knewwhat these were--this
is-but they're notthe originals.

435
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,290
He replicated timothy leary'sreading
glasses,but why?Check these out.

436
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,980
The guy who gave us lsd?

437
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:04,080
Dr.Leary experimentedwith a lot of different ways
to see beyond what our brainsare capable of seeing.

438
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,830
Okay,can I see those,please?

439
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,980
You know,the originals,when you put
them on,you never want totake 'em off.

440
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,480
Tell me about it.

441
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,850
- Artie?
- Yeah.

442
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,970
Um,that wooden box.Can I see that?

443
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,360
Thank you.

444
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,710
Fancy!

445
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,330
James always did havea
flair for the dramatic.

446
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,300
- Ladies first.
- What?

447
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,300
Uh,yeah,age before beauty.

448
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,520
What?He's older than me.

449
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,990
He's older than both of usput together.

450
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,800
All right,shut up.

451
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,040
Hold that.

452
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:45,710
Children.I'm working with children.

453
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:50,130
Okay...hand that to me.

454
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,360
- Be careful.
- Here.

455
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,770
Okay,don't tilt it.I've
got my lunch in there.

456
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,230
Okay.

457
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,480
These are warehouse 13 cratesthere.

458
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,690
Okay,it's--it's
really bad again.

459
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,540
- What is?Your vibe?
- Yeah.

460
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,940
About...?

461
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,020
Yes.

462
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,500
Well,when did youget it again?

463
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,340
As soon as we walkedin here.It
just kicked mein the gut.

464
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,240
Are you sure?

465
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,590
Yeah,that's whyI'm telling you.

466
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,230
Yeah,but you can't tell
himunless you're positive.

467
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,470
Okay,stop,stop.

468
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,140
What are you talking about?What vibe?

469
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,710
About me?

470
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:38,730
- Yeah.
- What about me?

471
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,060
Look,I don't know.

472
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,700
Artie,man,I hate this.

473
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,110
- Just tell me exactlywhat you're feeling.
- It's nothing.

474
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,800
I mean,I don't know yet.

475
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,770
Look,artie,all I know isI got a really
bad feeling in the pit of my stomach.

476
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:55,920
Well,when you geta really specific
feeling,just let me know,will you?

477
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,370
You'll be the first.

478
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,360
Okay,look,down here... see?

479
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,330
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna go down there alone.

480
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,660
Yes.And I want you guysto
go back around that way.

481
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,450
- I think it meets uparound the other side.
- No,no,no,no!Artie!Artie!Artie!No!

482
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,380
We shouldn't split up.

483
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:16,490
Look,if he really is planningan ambush,don't you
think it's best thatwe're not all caught up in it?

484
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,230
He does have a point.He has a point.

485
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,630
Artie!

486
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,180
Keep your tesla handy.

487
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,950
I'm fine.

488
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,820
Go.

489
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:41,190
I don't want to tell youanything more about it because
I'd prefer not to haveany competition with anybody.

490
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,970
It's all true.

491
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,970
I've seen itwith my own eyes.

492
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:50,560
A man rose from the ashes to
survive the blastof a furnace.

493
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,030
And seeing truly isbelieving.

494
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,940
- Wouldn't you say?
- Gentlemen,thank you all so muchfor joining me here today.

495
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,890
Mr.Pak,how are your ears?

496
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,570
A little better?

497
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,320
How's your vibe now?

498
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,490
- Not good.
- It's nice to see you.

499
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,620
As mr.Freitag hastold you all...

500
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,270
- what's he doing?
- I don't know.

501
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:24,520
The priceof this particular
item at 20 million,U.S.Currency.

502
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:29,400
Okay,possibilities.Um,artie knockedmacpherson
out and is pretendingto take his place.

503
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,710
Yeah,but they knew him.They
called him "mr.Nielsen.

504
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,620
" No,macpherson has some
kindof mind control over artie.

505
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,840
Well,it's a strange wayto use it.

506
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,810
- Well...
- okay,pete...

507
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:41,760
what if artie's trading in30 years
at the warehouse for $20 million?

508
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,170
Or...

509
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,660
oh,snap!

510
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,630
Artie is macpherson.

511
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,040
Uh,no.

512
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,930
Ohcome on,you don'tactually
believe that,do you?

513
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,220
Hold it right there,buddy?

514
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,820
Yeah,yeah,stay-stay there
untilwe figure this out.

515
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,940
Cut it out,you two.That's not me.I'm me.

516
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,030
I'll make an exception.

517
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,860
How are we supposedto know that?

518
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,850
Look.

519
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,730
Security cameras.

520
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,630
So?

521
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:14,180
He's setting me up.He tried to do
ita few weeks ago with honjo masamune.

522
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,300
You don't remember?

523
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,950
He went after the
swordplus he dug up my past.

524
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,260
I was arrested for treason!

525
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:23,380
This time he's gonnamake sure it sticks.

526
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:27,040
That must be why
mrs.Fredericsounded so strange.

527
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:30,030
Oh,so what,did he go outand
get an artie suit?Huh?

528
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,920
How do we know thatyou're
not him pretending to be you?

529
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,590
The thimble.

530
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,950
You really did readthe
whole manual,didn't you?

531
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,240
I did.

532
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,770
What--what
thimble?

533
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,470
Harriet tubman's thimble.

534
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,450
She wore it as she stitchedthe
rags of her fellow slaves.

535
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:48,190
It became imbued with
her dreamof a better life.

536
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:55,800
And it developed propertiesof light refraction,so that people saw
an imagedifferent from the image of the personwearing the thimble.

537
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,550
It came in very handyfor the underground
railroad during the civil war.

538
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,570
All right,well,let's
justgo in and blast him.

539
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,690
No,no,no,no,no,no.

540
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,150
No,he's expecting that.

541
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,150
Well,what's he notexpecting?

542
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,540
This--I
didn't--no.

543
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,920
No.There's no way.

544
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,170
Claudia.Claudia!

545
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,620
Leena...

546
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:23,150
mrs.Frederic,this place is my home.

547
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,110
I would never do anythingto hurt
any of you,least of all artie.

548
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,630
We know you wouldn'T.Not on purpose.

549
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,430
What does that mean?Do you think he putsome
kind of bug in my brain or something?

550
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,560
There are any numberof methods
to create sleeper agents.

551
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:42,160
Apparently macphersonhas amassed quite
a collectionof warehouse artifacts.

552
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,560
Then torture me.

553
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,470
You people do that.You've gotta have some
kindof truth serum laying around here somewhere.

554
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,130
Pump me full of it.

555
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,380
Read me!

556
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,960
Read my colors.Tell my fortune.

557
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,070
Whatever it is you
do,you can tell,right?

558
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,120
Yes,I can.

559
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,530
And I have.

560
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,360
Claudia,I'm sorry,but
something is wrong.

561
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,050
Oh,my god.

562
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,380
I'm like the freakin'
manchurian candidateor something.

563
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,830
What the hell!

564
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,680
Let her go.

565
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,270
For the time being it's bestif
she weren't in the warehouse.

566
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,840
- What if she disappears?
- She's being watched.

567
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,040
I've never seen herthis upset before.

568
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,490
That's what made jamessuch
an excellent agent.

569
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,540
He'd get inside your
head,throw you off your game.

570
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,460
Just when you thoughtyou had
the upper hand,he'd strike.

571
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,340
48 million going once...

572
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,200
twice...

573
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,450
sold to mr.Pak.

574
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,570
And when I get confirmation thatthe money is
in our account,then the phoenixwill be yours.

575
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,560
Wrong again,arthur.

576
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,620
Remember these?

577
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,270
Gentlemen,this next itemis something that
we went to a great dealof trouble to acquire.

578
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:08,910
Edgar allen poe's notebook,and his pen.

579
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:15,980
Together they give their ownerthe unique
ability to make what they writeactually happen.

580
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,860
- What is that?
- It's a fire alarm.

581
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,470
- We must get out of here.
- There's no need to panic.

582
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,310
Mr.Nielsen,I'd rather not be
here when the authorities arrive.

583
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,690
Excellent point.

584
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,100
Next time,mr.Nielsen.

585
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,440
Gentlemen...

586
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,310
federal agents!

587
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,760
Don't bother!

588
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,540
I'm sorry you went to all
thattrouble getting poe's pen.

589
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:40,150
I guess you wasted your
timeattacking my family.

590
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,810
Okay,pal,time for
youto finally get yours.

591
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,140
Just don't kill him.

592
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,520
He's an excellent
bodyguard.I'd hate to lose him.

593
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:53,110
Wha-who
the hell-

594
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,250
james macpherson,you're under arrest.

595
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,560
Aren't you adorable?

596
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:04,840
You didn't really think it
wasgonna be that easy,did you?

597
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,210
Do you rememberour old friend erik?

598
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:23,070
He made those wonderfulimplosion grenades,which
I demonstrated for youa few weeks ago.

599
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:28,440
Before his untimely death,I had him bring back
yet another old favorite--the eggshell bomb.

600
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,890
This time with a pinch of promethium.

601
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:37,020
If the slightest pressurecracks the
shell,it results in a smallnuclear reaction.

602
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,610
Small but dazzling.

603
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,320
Carson.

604
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:49,800
Now,you two dropthose little toys of
yours or arthur will losehis footing.

605
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,860
Thank you.

606
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:58,010
Jaw getting tired,arthur?

607
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,340
It won't be long now.

608
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,310
You were a warehouse agent.

609
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:02,930
What the hell happenedto you?

610
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,530
15 years of exile.

611
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:08,740
And now I wantto give arthur
back the gift he gave me.

612
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,870
But unfortunately,you're going
to be tried for your crimes...

613
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,020
posthumously.You think?

614
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,850
In your soul,you believe as I do.

615
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,370
That's the vibeyou've been feeling.

616
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,400
How do you knowwhat I'm feeling?

617
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,030
Because I know you,peter
lattimer,better than you know yourself.

618
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,310
I was you.

619
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:33,440
Shall I tell you the thought that
crosses your mindoccasionally?

620
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,220
What if these artifactsreally
do belong out in the world,

621
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:45,520
instead of being locked upby a gang of autocratic regentswho
see the universe through the blindersof their own bureaucracy?

622
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,340
Walk out of herewith me now...

623
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,570
and follow what you knowto
be true in your soul.

624
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,440
That's a nice speech.

625
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,940
It sounds even betterwith
the fancy accent.

626
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:09,380
- But it still doesn't coverthe fact that
- you are out of your gourd,mcnutty-pants!

627
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,830
You put a bombin a man's mouth.

628
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:15,190
Not really a greatrecruiting tool.

629
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,500
Fair enough.

630
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,730
Well,I'll be sayinggood-bye,then.

631
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,370
You expect us to justlet
you walk out of here?

632
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,110
No,no,I expect you to die while
you're tryingto save arthur.

633
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,100
And I'd say he's gotabout...

634
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,500
30 seconds.

635
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,990
Hey,mac.

636
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,310
Good catch.

637
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,140
So we're never turning
him into the government?

638
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,280
The government?

639
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,700
I don't think so.

640
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,950
He's already proventhat
prisons can't hold him.

641
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,200
So then,what happens to him?

642
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,700
I mean,we're not going to,you know...

643
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,650
no,no,no,no.Although he would happilykill
all of us without blinking an eye.

644
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,920
No,we don't operatelike that.

645
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,490
We'll put himin the bronze sector.

646
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,390
Arthur,I'm honored.

647
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:31,470
Okay,I promiseto read the manual this
weekend,but what--what is the bronze sector?

648
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,290
Actually,I don't rememberthat
being in the manual.

649
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,410
The bronze sector,children,is where the
mostdangerous people in history have been,um...

650
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,390
what's the generous phrase?

651
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,570
Preserved.

652
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,070
Yes,preserved.

653
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,270
People whose removalfrom
society had to be certain.

654
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,160
They're put in the bronzesector.

655
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,760
Locked for all eternityin warehouse 13?

656
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,460
How poetic.

657
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,340
Even a twisted mindcan be an artifact.

658
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,450
Let's go.

659
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,690
Aren't you forgettingsomething?

660
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,210
Uh,not that I canthink of.

661
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:17,690
My blood.If I remember correctly,my
veins will burstupon entry.

662
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,920
I say we give it a try,see what happens.

663
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,650
James...

664
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,370
what a bittersweet reunion.You've aged.

665
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,630
Mrs.Frederic,you haven'T.

666
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,140
You must tell meyour secret.

667
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,630
Perhaps on a warm summer dayover tea.

668
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,590
Perhaps not.

669
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,930
All this timeyou've had them.

670
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,760
How simple.

671
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,120
I wish I'd thought of it.

672
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,540
What are those?

673
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,640
Crystalline diamondswith
a trace of palladium.

674
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,790
Palladium?

675
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,000
It neutralizes the mineralsin his blood.

676
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,360
So he doesn't go kablooey.

677
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,280
Unfortunately.

678
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,940
That is a load off my mind.

679
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,860
Good-bye,james.

680
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,730
Yeah.

681
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,080
Let's go.

682
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,000
So why is the bronze
sectornot in the manual?

683
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,300
No,no,no,it's far too dangerous
for there to bea written record.

684
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:25,310
If someone were to findthis place,somehow reverse the
process-the point is we don't wantthese people out in the world.

685
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,920
So this place is filledwith,like,the
worst guys ever,right?

686
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,650
Hitler,mussolini,michael vick.

687
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:36,950
No,no,these aremen and women who would have
become hitlersand mussolinis or worse,except...

688
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,520
we got to them first.

689
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,680
A room filled with evilthat
you've never heard of.

690
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,590
Seems so unfair.

691
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:47,580
No,this is a processthat
was first explored in...

692
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,840
mesopotamia.

693
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,680
- In 1230
b-- uh,50.

694
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:54,190
1250 B.C.

695
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:59,830
Anyway,the bronzing processwas too heavy,and it kind
of cracked open-let's just sayit was unsuccessful.

696
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:06,240
Here,what we do is we flash-freeze the
bodiescryogenically,and we preserve themby bronzing.

697
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,610
Unfortunately...

698
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,620
it's a painless process.

699
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,440
Really?How many timeshave you tried it?

700
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,700
It's about as painfulas
a sword in the chest.

701
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,310
Touche.

702
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,870
What a beautiful creature.

703
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,800
A farewell gift,arthur?

704
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,210
You shouldn't have.

705
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,320
Just ignore the monsterin the cage.

706
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,820
Pete and myka,the stolen
artifacts have been loaded in.

707
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,040
Can I get your helpreplacing them?

708
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,920
Fine by me.

709
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,800
I'd rather not see this.

710
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,820
Oh,wait,come on.I want to watch this.

711
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:38,120
When's the next time
somethinglike this is gonna happen?

712
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,790
Hopefully never.

713
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,030
Who says you can nevergo
home again,eh,arthur?

714
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,740
James.

715
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,040
You know,I thought I'd
havea lot more to say to you.

716
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,990
Good-bye,james.

717
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,830
Arthur...

718
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,000
we can still be partners.

719
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:17,030
Pleading for your life?

720
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,400
That's out of characterfor you.

721
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:20,540
I'm not pleadingfor my life.

722
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,130
I'm pleading for yours.

723
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,950
You know,maybe I
shouldgo check on artie.

724
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,790
I'm sure he's fine.

725
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,620
You know what,I'll go check.

726
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,290
I'll be back in a second.

727
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,000
What a waste.

728
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:28,860
Gonna go downtown with my
baby 'cause she looks so-

729
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,220
Turn around.

730
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:04,790
My dear,thank youfor
remembering our appointment.

731
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,550
Oh,that is a relief!

732
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:13,180
Wave to arthur so he
can enjoythe tape later.

733
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,680
We're clear.

734
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,010
You won't be needing thatanymore.

735
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,520
So was it all worth it?

736
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,850
Unfettered accessto warehouse 13?

737
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,760
Time will tell.

738
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,080
There's work to be done.

739
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:59,420
The codes I implanted whenarthur tried
to access my site need to be activated.

740
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:01,240
Go on.

741
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,330
Tempus fugit.

742
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,420
Late,as usual.

743
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,750
How did you--get
away from there!

744
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,130
Or what?

745
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,750
You've had your chance,arthur!

746
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,460
So many chances!

747
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,850
Go ahead,fire it!

748
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:37,460
You see,there's a way
around almost anything...

749
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:38,870
partner!

750
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,060
Ne!

751
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,000
Artie. Artie! Artie!

752
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,800
Slyšíš mě?

753
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,430
Artie! Vstávej!

754
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:17,940
Artie. Artie! Artie! Vstávej!

755
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,870
Pete, rychle!

756
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,510
Look out.

757
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,380
***

758
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:43,070
