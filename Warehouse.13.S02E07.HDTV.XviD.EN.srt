1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Previously on <i>Warehouse 13...</i>

2
00:00:02,728 --> 00:00:03,848
Come on old friend

3
00:00:03,858 --> 00:00:05,878
so what, you think
our Jimmy took a playdate?

4
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:08,508
If there's a history log
in here, we could look up...

5
00:00:08,518 --> 00:00:09,638
There.

6
00:00:09,648 --> 00:00:12,448
Pete, Artie says
that H.G. Wells is actually--

7
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:13,578
a woman...

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,299
Could you please be careful
with that

9
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:16,429
I know all about it.

10
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:17,359
You what?

11
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:18,669
I was Apprenticed at Warehouse 12.

12
00:00:24,444 --> 00:00:25,610
Oh!

13
00:00:25,678 --> 00:00:27,212
Cavorite was
an anti-gravity metal

14
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,615
that Wells about,
but cavorite doesn't exist.

15
00:00:34,454 --> 00:00:35,320
James?

16
00:00:35,388 --> 00:00:36,655
James!

17
00:00:36,723 --> 00:00:40,592
I'm sorry, Arthur.

18
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,061
You stop trying
to confuse me!

19
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,531
Pete, you've been infected
by an artifact.

20
00:00:46,599 --> 00:00:48,500
Myka, you and Artie,
you got to get out of here.

21
00:00:48,568 --> 00:00:50,335
He's got snipers
all over the place!

22
00:00:50,403 --> 00:00:52,070
The telegraph seems
to have tapped

23
00:00:52,138 --> 00:00:54,139
into some subliminal anxiety.

24
00:00:54,207 --> 00:00:56,708
Take some time off,
Agent Lattimer.

25
00:00:56,776 --> 00:01:00,579
Hmm.

26
00:01:00,646 --> 00:01:02,647
I guess I'm just
lucky that

27
00:01:02,715 --> 00:01:04,483
the only vet in Univille
makes house-calls.

28
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,018
I love ferrets.

29
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:07,552
Besides, this is
a farming community

30
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,121
and if I didn't
make house-calls,

31
00:01:09,188 --> 00:01:12,290
my office would look
like a traveling circus.

32
00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:14,826
Myka!

33
00:01:14,894 --> 00:01:17,129
Guess how many croissants
I shoved into my mouth at once.

34
00:01:17,196 --> 00:01:18,497
One day you'll have
to tell me

35
00:01:18,564 --> 00:01:20,065
how you got partnered up
with that one.

36
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:22,634
Well, the croissant thing's
actually kind of impressive

37
00:01:22,702 --> 00:01:24,036
when you see it.

38
00:01:24,103 --> 00:01:25,003
Yeah, at least it keeps him
from talking.

39
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:26,505
Oh, that's right.

40
00:01:26,572 --> 00:01:28,373
You prefer your males
to bark and hump your leg.

41
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:29,708
I'm sure it's
in your repertoire.

42
00:01:29,776 --> 00:01:31,543
Okay, okay.

43
00:01:31,611 --> 00:01:33,045
Thank you.

44
00:01:33,112 --> 00:01:34,546
You know, we have
to get back to work,

45
00:01:34,614 --> 00:01:35,981
but thank you so much
for coming.

46
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:37,382
Myka, for you, anytime.

47
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,553
Okay.

48
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:43,455
What is with you two?
She started it.

49
00:01:43,523 --> 00:01:45,157
Good, good, you're here.
Follow me.

50
00:01:45,224 --> 00:01:46,792
We got a ping.

51
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:47,959
Awesome.
Time to get back out there

52
00:01:48,027 --> 00:01:49,895
and kick some artifact butt.

53
00:01:49,962 --> 00:01:51,430
Mmm, not you, no.

54
00:01:51,497 --> 00:01:53,231
Until we're sure that
there's no residual effect

55
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:55,033
from your last encounter,
you are grounded.

56
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:57,035
Myka, you're going
to Tamalpais University

57
00:01:57,103 --> 00:01:58,637
in Northern California.

58
00:01:58,704 --> 00:02:00,038
Artie, this is about
a wrestling team.

59
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:03,942
God, all right, all right.
Yes, yes.

60
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,444
It's about a wrestling team.

61
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:07,646
This wrestling team,
they've lost every match

62
00:02:07,713 --> 00:02:09,581
for the last seven years
and overnight,

63
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:11,049
they've become unstoppable.

64
00:02:11,117 --> 00:02:13,051
No, this is--
this is one of ours.

65
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:15,754
I know you wrestled in college.

66
00:02:15,822 --> 00:02:17,956
What can I say?
Irony is my specialty.

67
00:02:18,024 --> 00:02:19,624
So--
grounded!

68
00:02:19,692 --> 00:02:22,194
This team was tested
for steroids, right?

69
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:24,162
One of the kids
on the team died

70
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,631
three weeks ago,

71
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:29,267
in a fire,
alone, camping.

72
00:02:29,335 --> 00:02:30,702
If an artifact
is helping them,

73
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,204
it could also be killing them.

74
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:33,271
Okay, I'm on it.

75
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:34,806
Yeah, Claudia, take this,

76
00:02:34,874 --> 00:02:37,342
because you're going with Myka
to California as a backup.

77
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,444
For reals?

78
00:02:39,512 --> 00:02:42,280
My first official assignment
as an Agent?

79
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:44,683
Shut up!
As...An Apprentice.

80
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,351
While you're on campus,

81
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:48,286
enroll and get a degree,
will you?

82
00:02:48,354 --> 00:02:52,057
Will you never stop
with that?

83
00:03:05,304 --> 00:03:09,207
Should I have worn something
more business-suity,

84
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:10,876
you know, so people take
me seriously as an Agent?

85
00:03:10,943 --> 00:03:12,544
You're not an Agent.
You're an Apprentice.

86
00:03:12,612 --> 00:03:14,012
Right.
Apprentice.

87
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,080
Taking notes.

88
00:03:15,148 --> 00:03:17,382
"Jeans are fine."

89
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,355
Well, it looks
like they won again.

90
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:25,190
Think the artifact's in here?

91
00:03:25,258 --> 00:03:28,326
Anything's possible,
but artifacts don't talk.

92
00:03:28,394 --> 00:03:30,195
People talk.

93
00:03:30,263 --> 00:03:31,463
Right.

94
00:03:31,531 --> 00:03:33,932
Interviews with people, indeed.

95
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,502
I'm ready to begin
my Apprentice education.

96
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,504
Hoo-wah!

97
00:03:39,572 --> 00:03:41,940
Always happy to answer
questions on how much

98
00:03:42,008 --> 00:03:44,242
we're winning, but I'm not
sure what exactly

99
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,579
you're investigating.

100
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:50,081
Apprentice really
be in here?

101
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:52,884
We just have some routine
questions for you.

102
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:54,986
Gary!

103
00:03:55,054 --> 00:03:57,189
Gary, come talk
to these ladies.

104
00:03:57,256 --> 00:03:59,691
Sure, Coach.
What's up?

105
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,459
Hi, Gary, is it?

106
00:04:01,527 --> 00:04:03,762
So why do you think your team
started winning?

107
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:05,063
I mean, what changed?

108
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:06,831
Coach Tappon finally
got our asses in gear.

109
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:08,533
He got us to want it again.

110
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:10,969
And if you want it bad enough,
you're gonna crush it.

111
00:04:11,037 --> 00:04:12,871
And now we're crushing it.

112
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:15,440
But seven straight seasons
without a win

113
00:04:15,508 --> 00:04:17,642
and now all of a sudden--

114
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,543
Oh!

115
00:04:20,313 --> 00:04:21,947
Claudia, do you want
to see what's going on

116
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:22,948
out in the hallway?

117
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:25,217
Okay, thanks, bye.

118
00:04:33,492 --> 00:04:35,594
Hey.

119
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:37,162
Hey, aren't you the guy
who just won?

120
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,297
I feel weird.

121
00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:41,733
My muscles are hurting bad.

122
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:43,201
I think I need a--

123
00:04:46,939 --> 00:04:48,773
Ah!

124
00:04:52,912 --> 00:04:55,614
Myka!
Myka!

127
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:33,553
One death on the team
is bad enough.

128
00:05:33,607 --> 00:05:37,376
Two is...Unthinkable.

129
00:05:37,444 --> 00:05:39,812
But I know Phillip
would want us to go on.

130
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,214
How'd it go with the police?

131
00:05:42,282 --> 00:05:44,984
He just caught on fire, Myka.

132
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:48,287
I should have done something.

133
00:05:48,355 --> 00:05:50,189
There wasn't anything to do.

134
00:05:50,257 --> 00:05:51,724
You would have
done something.

135
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:52,825
You would
stay calm at least.

136
00:05:52,893 --> 00:05:56,629
I literally freaked out.

137
00:05:56,696 --> 00:05:58,030
So the police are calling
it an accident?

138
00:05:58,098 --> 00:05:59,965
Of undetermined cause.

139
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:02,434
But I hacked the coroner's
report on both desks.

140
00:06:02,502 --> 00:06:03,636
Check it out.

141
00:06:03,703 --> 00:06:04,737
Teddy Benson,
the wrestler who died

142
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,205
in the campsite fire?

143
00:06:06,273 --> 00:06:07,339
Burn patterns show
that the fire

144
00:06:07,407 --> 00:06:09,208
started inside
his sleeping bag.

145
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:13,379
Okay, so two deaths by
spontaneous combustion

146
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:15,047
on the same wrestling team.

147
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:16,815
Yeah, I call shenanigans.

148
00:06:16,883 --> 00:06:20,786
And unless a sweaty gym sock
is the artifact,

149
00:06:20,854 --> 00:06:25,491
then there's nothing that--

150
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:26,892
okay, there's that.

151
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,594
Hoo-wah!

152
00:06:28,662 --> 00:06:31,330
Oh, yeah.
You can score that a 9.8.

153
00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:33,432
All right, I'm gonna
go talk to the Coach

154
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,035
about that medal and you
follow up with the team.

155
00:06:36,102 --> 00:06:37,336
Wait. Follow up?

156
00:06:37,404 --> 00:06:38,370
By myself?
Yeah.

157
00:06:38,438 --> 00:06:39,505
Talk to them.

158
00:06:39,572 --> 00:06:40,706
You know, investigate.

159
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:43,876
Sure.
Yeah, I'll just follow up.

160
00:06:51,318 --> 00:06:53,352
Ahh, mom!

161
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,920
Pete!

162
00:06:54,988 --> 00:06:56,488
Are those Timothy Leary's
glasses?

163
00:06:56,556 --> 00:06:58,157
Take them off right now.
That's not a toy.

164
00:06:58,224 --> 00:06:59,491
I'm bored, okay?

165
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:01,360
They make things
so much less boring.

166
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:03,162
Did you hear what I said?
Take 'em off right now.

167
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:04,596
Right now.

168
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:06,065
Wouldn't you rather
have a nice little fish?

169
00:07:06,132 --> 00:07:07,599
Okay, stop it.

170
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:09,535
Give me the glasses.
Don't!

171
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:11,503
Get up out of my chair.

172
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:12,871
Child.

173
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:15,841
Man, desk duty is lame.

174
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:17,376
Ow.

175
00:07:17,444 --> 00:07:19,078
Oh, it's nothing personal,
<i>senor sensitivo.</i>

176
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:22,047
No.
Ow.

177
00:07:22,115 --> 00:07:23,749
What?
What? What is it?

178
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:25,985
It's nothing.
It's no big deal.

179
00:07:26,052 --> 00:07:28,887
It's just probably
my appendix growing back.

180
00:07:28,955 --> 00:07:31,423
Your who with the what now?

181
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:34,193
Yeah, it's, uh...

182
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,161
Grows back every year.

183
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:38,530
It's a side effect of spending
too much time

184
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:39,865
in the Warehouse.

185
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:41,300
Hmm?

186
00:07:41,368 --> 00:07:42,368
Nothing to worry about.

187
00:07:42,435 --> 00:07:44,136
It's all good.

188
00:07:44,204 --> 00:07:46,105
Yeah, I need a visit
from the doctor.

189
00:07:46,172 --> 00:07:51,877
Yeah.

190
00:07:51,945 --> 00:07:53,512
What?

191
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,581
Are you serious?

192
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:57,983
Touching a gold medal caused
them to burn up?

193
00:07:58,051 --> 00:07:59,585
You got both paddles
in the water?

194
00:07:59,652 --> 00:08:00,786
You were a champion.

195
00:08:00,854 --> 00:08:02,221
Now you're a Coach.

196
00:08:02,288 --> 00:08:03,422
I know what it's like
to do good work

197
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,790
and no one notices.

198
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:07,326
A winning team puts you
back on top.

199
00:08:07,394 --> 00:08:09,294
Whoa.

200
00:08:09,362 --> 00:08:10,996
You think I'm involved
in their deaths?

201
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:12,498
You're out of your mind.

202
00:08:12,565 --> 00:08:14,033
If I'm crazy,
show me the medal.

203
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,734
I'm not showing you anything.

204
00:08:15,802 --> 00:08:18,170
Coach Tappon, we'd love
for you to join us

205
00:08:18,238 --> 00:08:19,805
whenever you're free.

206
00:08:19,873 --> 00:08:21,106
Great, Jeff.
I'm sorry.

207
00:08:21,174 --> 00:08:22,107
Just give me a sec.

208
00:08:22,175 --> 00:08:25,010
Be right with you.

209
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:31,083
Great.

210
00:08:31,151 --> 00:08:33,552
Now I'm pissing off
the team's benefactors

211
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,453
so you can accuse me
of attacking my guys.

212
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:35,854
I am just trying to protect--

213
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:37,589
if you scare my guys,
I'll have you

214
00:08:37,657 --> 00:08:43,262
thrown off this campus.

215
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:50,602
So, Gary, is it?

216
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,871
Yeah.
Um...

217
00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:55,307
Can I help you?

218
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,143
So Coach Tappon.

219
00:08:58,211 --> 00:09:02,114
Does he ever seem maybe
too intent on winning?

220
00:09:02,182 --> 00:09:04,383
"Too intent on winning"?

221
00:09:04,451 --> 00:09:06,785
I don't even know
what that means.

222
00:09:06,853 --> 00:09:10,656
I mean does he put you under
a lot of, you know, pressure?

223
00:09:10,723 --> 00:09:12,724
Pressure?

224
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:14,460
Have you ever tried getting out
of a half nelson

225
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:16,528
with a 200-pound monster's
on top of you?

226
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:18,030
Okay, now when you say,
"monster,"

227
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:19,565
I'm gonna assume you mean
a really big guy

228
00:09:19,632 --> 00:09:21,900
and not an actual monster,
because in my line of work--

229
00:09:21,968 --> 00:09:23,969
what I mean
is pressure is good.

230
00:09:24,037 --> 00:09:25,237
It makes you win.

231
00:09:25,305 --> 00:09:26,772
Okay, yes, but does
the Coach care

232
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,774
about your safety
or just winning?

233
00:09:28,842 --> 00:09:31,376
Would he risk a wrestler's life
to, I don't know,

234
00:09:31,444 --> 00:09:32,811
place in a match--

235
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,012
hey, this is my Coach
we're talking about.

236
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,147
I'm not gonna let you
rip on him.

237
00:09:35,215 --> 00:09:36,348
Oh, no, no, no.

238
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,383
No, I wouldn't deign to rip.

239
00:09:38,451 --> 00:09:39,985
I'm just...

240
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:43,422
Observing,
analyzing the facts,

241
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,425
supposing a possible--
interrogating the--

242
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:48,760
not that you--
you okay?

243
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:51,263
You seem kind of new at this.

244
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:54,299
Are you, like, that other lady's
assistant or something?

245
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:55,901
Or something.

246
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:59,505
If I need anything,
I'll circle back.

247
00:09:59,572 --> 00:10:03,375
Thanks so much
for coming, doctor.

248
00:10:03,443 --> 00:10:04,576
And how's that?

249
00:10:04,644 --> 00:10:05,944
Does that hurt?
It's fine.

250
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:07,412
No, no.
How about there?

251
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,747
No.

252
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:11,383
So our own Warehouse doctor,
huh?

253
00:10:11,451 --> 00:10:13,185
Yes, Pete,
it's in the manual,

254
00:10:13,253 --> 00:10:16,388
chapter 112, section F,
paragraph 3.

255
00:10:16,456 --> 00:10:17,823
Yeah, yeah.

256
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:20,459
I haven't quite gotten
to chapter 112 yet.

257
00:10:20,527 --> 00:10:21,727
Yeah, why don't you
go downstairs

258
00:10:21,794 --> 00:10:23,028
and read it right now?

259
00:10:23,096 --> 00:10:24,730
Well, I was hoping you'd read
it to me, papa.

260
00:10:24,797 --> 00:10:26,932
Vanessa, I'm really
sorry about him.

261
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,267
And I'm sorry you have
to come all the way

262
00:10:28,334 --> 00:10:29,701
to South Dakota just for this.

263
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:31,303
Oh, well, your appendix
is always

264
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:32,638
the highlight
of my year, Artie.

265
00:10:32,705 --> 00:10:33,839
Wow.

266
00:10:33,907 --> 00:10:38,443
What's the rest
of your year like?

267
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:39,945
Have you been working
on your meridians?

268
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:41,613
My--

269
00:10:41,681 --> 00:10:44,383
the acupuncture points
I asked you to tap on like this.

270
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,218
Yeah, just--I remember.
Ah!

271
00:10:46,286 --> 00:10:47,819
I'm really ticklish there.

272
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:49,021
You can't do that.
I know.

273
00:10:49,088 --> 00:10:50,222
Sit up.
Okay.

274
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,657
Yes, I have, actually.

275
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:53,225
I've worked on--
oh, you're lying.

276
00:10:53,293 --> 00:10:54,426
Yes, I am.

277
00:10:54,494 --> 00:10:55,694
If you're gonna blow hot air,

278
00:10:55,762 --> 00:10:59,431
will you mind blowing into this
for me, please?

279
00:11:05,338 --> 00:11:06,471
Well, you're not infected.

280
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:07,539
Oh, that's good, right?

281
00:11:07,607 --> 00:11:10,475
Yeah, it's good.

282
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:12,377
Given your proclivity
to appendicitis,

283
00:11:12,445 --> 00:11:14,613
I really still think we should
remove it again.

284
00:11:14,681 --> 00:11:16,415
Okay.
Just prophylactically.

285
00:11:17,784 --> 00:11:19,251
"Prophylactically"?

286
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:21,420
Shut up.

287
00:11:21,487 --> 00:11:22,921
I place myself in your hands.

288
00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:24,890
Okay, let me go
put on some scrubs.

289
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,358
Prepare the procedure room
and I'll let you know

290
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:27,593
when I'm ready for you, okay?

291
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,063
Okay, awesome.

292
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:45,344
Maybe I'm wrong,
but...

293
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:47,613
Are Vanessa and Artie
sitting in a tree?

294
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,314
Ah, don't be absurd.

295
00:11:49,382 --> 00:11:50,949
We're two adults
who just have a lot

296
00:11:51,017 --> 00:11:52,751
of professional respect
for each other.

297
00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:54,553
And shut up.
K-I-s-s-I-n-g.

298
00:11:54,621 --> 00:11:55,821
I knew it.

299
00:11:55,888 --> 00:11:56,955
Artie is human.

300
00:11:57,023 --> 00:11:58,290
Walk away.

301
00:11:58,358 --> 00:11:59,491
You like her.
Stop it.

302
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,026
You want to hug her
and kiss her...

303
00:12:01,094 --> 00:12:02,094
Right.
I'm walking away.

304
00:12:02,161 --> 00:12:03,328
And squeeze her
and all right!

305
00:12:03,396 --> 00:12:05,264
Don't touch me there.

306
00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:09,768
Good, you've
got the purple goo.

307
00:12:09,836 --> 00:12:11,303
Coach Tappon's office
is empty.

308
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:13,572
Artie said there's no record
of Tappon's medal on file,

309
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,873
but we should still
goo it just in case.

310
00:12:14,941 --> 00:12:16,408
It was hard to hear.

311
00:12:16,476 --> 00:12:18,543
Pete kept singing something
about Artie in a baby carriage.

312
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:20,746
Good.
Well, let's go get this medal.

313
00:12:20,813 --> 00:12:22,814
Do you think he's
doing this on purpose?

314
00:12:22,882 --> 00:12:25,183
No, but I think
he's hiding something.

315
00:12:25,251 --> 00:12:27,619
How can you tell, like,
just from one interview?

316
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:28,987
I mean, is that instinct?

317
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,589
Well, instinct
is just a fancy way of saying

318
00:12:30,657 --> 00:12:32,691
I've done this 10,000 times.

319
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:34,393
You don't think maybe
this guy's different?

320
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,927
Well, human beings
are predictable

321
00:12:35,995 --> 00:12:38,263
and people rarely
surprise you.

322
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:51,877
Turn around and put
your hands in the air.

323
00:12:51,944 --> 00:12:56,448
Slowly.

324
00:12:56,516 --> 00:13:00,018
H.G. Wells.

325
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:01,586
Agent Bering.

326
00:13:01,654 --> 00:13:04,323
Seems we're forever destined
to meet at gunpoint.

327
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:09,403
Ladies, I know this
is a bit awkward,

328
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,004
but maybe we could just--

329
00:13:13,274 --> 00:13:14,975
Or we could just do this.

330
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:19,012
You are going back
to the Bronze Sector.

331
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,314
Why?
What did I do?

332
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:23,417
You're a killer and a thief.

333
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:25,886
Brain requires...
Oxygen...

334
00:13:25,954 --> 00:13:27,154
To speak.

335
00:13:27,222 --> 00:13:30,224
Myka.

336
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:34,761
Oh!

337
00:13:37,098 --> 00:13:38,865
I'm not a killer.

338
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:40,033
Oh, has the definition
of "killer"

339
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:42,202
changed a bunch since
the 1890s?

340
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,937
'Cause, H.G.,
you killed a guy.

341
00:13:44,005 --> 00:13:46,740
James MacPherson?

342
00:13:46,808 --> 00:13:50,077
He would have quite happily
killed all of you.

343
00:13:50,144 --> 00:13:51,478
Why are you here?

344
00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:53,714
Did you just happen
to show up?

345
00:13:53,781 --> 00:13:57,884
I'm hunting for the same
artifact as you.

346
00:13:57,952 --> 00:13:59,953
That's what we're looking for.

347
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:02,556
That's rather my point.

348
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:04,825
Take it.

349
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:11,665
And if you didn't believe me
just a little,

350
00:14:11,733 --> 00:14:13,400
you'd have shot me by now.

351
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:16,403
The Coach.

352
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:18,572
He can't find us here.

353
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,941
He can't find you in here.

354
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:22,476
He hasn't met me yet.

355
00:14:22,543 --> 00:14:23,910
What? Do not.
Don't.

356
00:14:23,978 --> 00:14:26,013
No.

357
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,514
Is your name Coach Tappon?

358
00:14:27,582 --> 00:14:29,516
Yeah.
Oh, thank God I've found you.

359
00:14:29,584 --> 00:14:31,551
She's good.

360
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:34,988
Yeah, sure,
in an obvious kind of way.

361
00:14:35,056 --> 00:14:36,556
Worked on Pete in London.

362
00:14:36,624 --> 00:14:39,259
Well, that's not exactly
scaling Mt. Everest, is it?

363
00:14:39,327 --> 00:14:41,061
Come on, let's call Artie.

364
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:49,436
An appendectomy?
Are you--

365
00:14:49,504 --> 00:14:51,138
yeah, forget--
I'm fine.

366
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:53,373
Just tell me exactly
what's going on.

367
00:14:53,441 --> 00:14:54,875
Room's all set.
Are you?

368
00:14:54,942 --> 00:14:56,543
Uh, as ever.

369
00:14:56,611 --> 00:14:57,411
Just one second,
'cause I'm in the--

370
00:14:57,478 --> 00:14:58,612
okay.

371
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,013
Yeah, look--

372
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:01,315
you know what?
I got it.

373
00:15:01,382 --> 00:15:03,750
Just--just take care
of yourself.

374
00:15:03,818 --> 00:15:06,119
Okay, thanks.

375
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:08,855
My turn.
Oh.

376
00:15:08,923 --> 00:15:11,024
Don't start without me.

377
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:21,168
What?

378
00:15:21,235 --> 00:15:24,171
Nothing.

379
00:15:24,238 --> 00:15:25,906
I was just wondering...

380
00:15:25,973 --> 00:15:29,009
What <i>this...</i>

381
00:15:29,077 --> 00:15:30,477
Was doing on your shelf.

382
00:15:30,545 --> 00:15:32,145
Yeah, I'm wondering
what you're doing

383
00:15:32,213 --> 00:15:33,380
messing around
with my thing.

384
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:34,815
That's the Barnum to

385
00:15:34,882 --> 00:15:36,350
Ba-bam!

386
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:37,984
Oh, that's right, sir.

387
00:15:38,052 --> 00:15:40,087
I've been doing
a little read-a-roonie

388
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:41,855
of the artifact manifest.

389
00:15:41,923 --> 00:15:43,123
Fascinating stuff.

390
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:46,226
Turns out P.T. Barnum
used this to,

391
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:50,097
and I quote,
"increase the shock factor

392
00:15:50,164 --> 00:15:52,699
"in his sideshows by using it
to grow human limbs

393
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:55,769
and in some cases,
internal organs."

394
00:15:55,837 --> 00:15:59,239
You, sir, have been growing
back your appendix

395
00:15:59,307 --> 00:16:02,476
in an attempt to get Vanessa
to visit the Warehouse!

396
00:16:05,213 --> 00:16:06,346
That's so romantic.

397
00:16:06,414 --> 00:16:07,748
Are you quite finished?

398
00:16:07,815 --> 00:16:10,083
If only...
So, "no," then.

399
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:14,054
There were some way
for you to...

400
00:16:14,122 --> 00:16:17,724
Interact with Vanessa
that did not involve

401
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:21,194
invasive surgery.

402
00:16:21,262 --> 00:16:23,764
Perhaps some kind of--

403
00:16:23,831 --> 00:16:25,632
I don't know.

404
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,701
Social ritual.

405
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:31,872
One involving the sharing
of food or the enjoying

406
00:16:31,939 --> 00:16:35,509
of filmed entertainment
with maybe some duds

407
00:16:35,576 --> 00:16:38,378
that have been milked.

408
00:16:38,446 --> 00:16:41,581
Ahh.

409
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:42,816
I mean a date.

410
00:16:42,884 --> 00:16:44,684
I know what you mean.

411
00:16:44,752 --> 00:16:46,286
Artie, you like her.

412
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:48,622
She--hey, hey, hey--likes you.

413
00:16:48,689 --> 00:16:49,856
Ask the woman out.

414
00:16:49,924 --> 00:16:50,957
Okay.

415
00:16:51,025 --> 00:16:54,294
Artie?

416
00:16:54,362 --> 00:16:55,429
I'm sorry.

417
00:16:55,496 --> 00:16:56,696
I'm gonna have
to postpone the surgery.

418
00:16:56,764 --> 00:16:58,465
A Regent has tungsten poisoning,
of all things,

419
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:00,534
and I have to leave
for Budapest immediately.

420
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:02,969
Ooh, that sounds
serious there.

421
00:17:03,037 --> 00:17:04,905
You should go.
All right.

422
00:17:04,972 --> 00:17:06,239
Yeah.

423
00:17:06,307 --> 00:17:11,344
I got to make my flight
arrangements.

424
00:17:11,412 --> 00:17:12,746
Get out of my sight.

425
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:15,248
Don't come near me.
I'll kill you.

426
00:17:21,722 --> 00:17:23,123
Really?
Nothing?

427
00:17:23,191 --> 00:17:24,591
Nope.

428
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:26,526
The medal is not
the artifact,

429
00:17:26,594 --> 00:17:29,362
which also means that H.G.
had nothing to lose

430
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,997
by handing it over.

431
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:31,898
Unless she
didn't know either.

432
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:33,567
Oh, she knew.

433
00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:36,403
I don't know what her game is,
but I don't trust her.

434
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:37,704
Well, I swiped Tappon's
records

435
00:17:37,772 --> 00:17:39,573
from the personnel office.

436
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,007
Last month, he moved
to bayside heights.

437
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:42,742
Very schmancy and Richie Rich.

438
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,011
Where does a college wrestling
Coach get the money

439
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:46,079
to buy a house like that?

440
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:48,148
Maybe H.G.'S paying him off.

441
00:17:48,216 --> 00:17:49,416
Where would she get the money?

442
00:17:49,484 --> 00:17:50,584
Well, you accrue
a lot of interest

443
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:51,952
in 100 years.

444
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:53,386
I'm gonna go snoop around
for a connection.

445
00:17:53,454 --> 00:17:55,889
You finish interviewing
the wrestling team.

446
00:17:55,957 --> 00:17:58,625
Um, no, maybe I should stick
to the computer stuff.

447
00:17:58,693 --> 00:18:00,794
I'm really not good
at the interviews,

448
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:02,796
especially with,
you know, people.

449
00:18:02,864 --> 00:18:04,731
Mm-hmm.

450
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,102
Okay, so...
Why do you say that?

451
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,438
Well, I tried to be
like you, you know?

452
00:18:11,506 --> 00:18:14,274
All professional and adult
and that--

453
00:18:14,342 --> 00:18:16,643
is really...

454
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:18,578
Really dumb.

455
00:18:18,646 --> 00:18:20,313
Is that your version
of a pep talk?

456
00:18:20,381 --> 00:18:22,716
No.

457
00:18:22,783 --> 00:18:24,384
We already have one me.

458
00:18:24,452 --> 00:18:26,319
We don't need
another me, okay?

459
00:18:26,387 --> 00:18:28,188
I want you to go in there
and be more like you.

460
00:18:28,256 --> 00:18:29,789
What would that get us?

461
00:18:29,857 --> 00:18:31,691
Claudia, you're the same age
as these guys.

462
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:32,893
You're a peer.

463
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,327
You can connect with them.

464
00:18:34,395 --> 00:18:37,597
Yeah, not so much.

465
00:18:37,665 --> 00:18:39,566
Okay.
Okay then.

466
00:18:39,634 --> 00:18:41,835
Go back to the Warehouse then.

467
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:44,471
You know, not everyone's
cut out for field work.

468
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:47,040
You know, stay behind
a computer forever.

469
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:48,942
Forever's
kind of a long time.

470
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,677
I don't have time to hold
your hand through this, Claude.

471
00:18:50,745 --> 00:18:52,245
If you are not up for this--

472
00:18:52,313 --> 00:18:53,547
well, I didn't say that.

473
00:18:53,614 --> 00:18:54,848
Okay, well,
let me know how it goes.

474
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,316
Okay, I will.

475
00:18:56,384 --> 00:18:58,151
Good then.
Good.

476
00:18:58,219 --> 00:18:59,419
Oh, I know
what you did there.

477
00:18:59,487 --> 00:19:00,687
I know.

478
00:19:00,755 --> 00:19:03,256
It's 'cause you're smart.

479
00:19:03,324 --> 00:19:07,227
Go.

480
00:19:08,696 --> 00:19:10,263
Gar-bear, afternoon.

481
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:11,731
Let's talk.
Hey.

482
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:13,199
Irritating question girl.

483
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:15,135
We kind of already talked.

484
00:19:15,202 --> 00:19:16,570
No, you already avoided
telling me anything.

485
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:17,671
Now we talk.

486
00:19:17,738 --> 00:19:19,906
By the way, Photoshop.

487
00:19:19,974 --> 00:19:22,342
Anyway, check this.

488
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,511
Phillip and Teddy's deaths were
not accidental.

489
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:26,580
My Intel says Coach is dirty.

490
00:19:26,647 --> 00:19:28,148
Maybe even got some payola.

491
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:32,552
Thoughts?

492
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,887
Stratego.

493
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:35,355
What do you know?

494
00:19:35,423 --> 00:19:37,390
Nothing.

495
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:38,458
It's just a feeling.

496
00:19:38,526 --> 00:19:39,926
Spill it, hulkling.

497
00:19:39,994 --> 00:19:42,696
Don't make me angry.

498
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:49,903
Coach Tappon saved us, okay?

499
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:51,271
I mean, in a town like this,

500
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:52,939
you either work at the
bottling plant or you get out.

501
00:19:53,007 --> 00:19:55,208
And now even the plant's
about to close down.

502
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:57,978
Because of Coach,
now I have options

503
00:19:58,045 --> 00:20:00,213
and maybe a scholarship.

504
00:20:00,281 --> 00:20:01,648
I have people who did that
for me too.

505
00:20:01,716 --> 00:20:02,849
Gave me options.

506
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:03,850
Then you know
I can't turn on him.

507
00:20:03,918 --> 00:20:08,154
Yeah, but, dude...

508
00:20:08,222 --> 00:20:09,990
If something bad's happening
to your friends,

509
00:20:10,057 --> 00:20:14,394
even by accident,
don't you owe them too?

510
00:20:17,264 --> 00:20:20,600
He started acting weird
after Teddy died.

511
00:20:20,668 --> 00:20:22,268
Closed-door meetings,

512
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:24,838
phone calls in the middle
of practice.

513
00:20:24,905 --> 00:20:25,872
He was acting--

514
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,374
guilty?

515
00:20:27,441 --> 00:20:29,476
No.

516
00:20:29,543 --> 00:20:32,846
Scared.

517
00:20:32,913 --> 00:20:34,447
No, it's too dangerous.

518
00:20:34,515 --> 00:20:36,583
Listen to me.
They think I'm responsible.

519
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:38,418
And what if I am?

520
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:39,986
No, I'm sorry,

521
00:20:40,054 --> 00:20:42,789
but I'm ending this now.

522
00:20:58,827 --> 00:20:59,961
Okay, here's <i>here we go.</i>
What you're gonna do.

523
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:01,533
Set something up for when
she gets back.

524
00:21:02,073 --> 00:21:02,906
Dinner, a movie--
shh! Shh!

525
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:04,641
I can't do that.

526
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,076
Take her for a walk.

527
00:21:06,143 --> 00:21:08,445
Show her the dark vault.
Doesn't matter, okay?

528
00:21:08,512 --> 00:21:10,346
Just make a plan.

529
00:21:10,414 --> 00:21:12,315
I don't know--
okay.

530
00:21:12,383 --> 00:21:14,184
Then be one of those agents
that's obsessed

531
00:21:14,251 --> 00:21:15,251
with the Warehouse.

532
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:18,088
That always works out so well.

533
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:21,291
All right.

534
00:21:21,358 --> 00:21:23,793
Well, now you know
you're not infected,

535
00:21:23,861 --> 00:21:25,462
so you should be all right
till I get back, Artie.

536
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:26,830
You okay with this?

537
00:21:26,897 --> 00:21:32,869
Um...

538
00:21:32,937 --> 00:21:35,939
Have a nice flight.

539
00:21:38,106 --> 00:21:39,907
Thanks.

540
00:21:43,981 --> 00:21:45,281
Geez, Artie,

541
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:47,250
it's not like she hasn't
already seen you naked.

542
00:21:47,318 --> 00:21:50,253
Thank you very much for that.

543
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:59,518
This was no accident.

544
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:00,819
It means someone else
out there knows

545
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:04,590
about the artifact.

546
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:09,661
Look who's here.

547
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:13,265
Keep an eye
on things, Claude.

548
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,334
Hey!

549
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:19,738
Our lead suspect is killed
and look who shows up.

550
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:21,573
Oh, do stop it.

551
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:23,308
What motive could
I have possibly had

552
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:26,345
for killing those boys
and a wrestling Coach?

553
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:28,046
That's an excellent question.

554
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:29,281
Perhaps we should
ask the Regents.

555
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:31,483
They did have you
bronzed once.

556
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:33,585
You know as well as I,
women are held

557
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:35,721
to a different standard.

558
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:38,223
Something, by the way, I thought
would have changed by now.

559
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:40,559
Don't you dare play
that card with me.

560
00:22:40,627 --> 00:22:42,995
Why not?

561
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:45,364
Your partner died
and people whispered.

562
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:47,366
If you'd been a man--
nice.

563
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:48,500
That's very clever.

564
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:50,669
You did your research.

565
00:22:50,737 --> 00:22:54,773
What did you steal
from the Escher Vault?

566
00:22:56,943 --> 00:23:00,779
That's what I thought.

567
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:05,217
I took back what was mine.

568
00:23:05,285 --> 00:23:07,286
Oh, and what is that?

569
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:10,422
That more cavorite?

570
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:14,793
What are you gonna do,
yank me up into the sky?

571
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:17,062
The only power
it has is over me.

572
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,070
It's my daughter.

573
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:26,104
Was.

574
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:29,408
My Christina.

575
00:23:29,475 --> 00:23:32,978
Everything that ever mattered
in my life is gone now,

576
00:23:33,046 --> 00:23:36,882
except the Warehouse.

577
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,485
Look, I know what it's like
to lose someone, but--

578
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:42,321
I want to come back
and work there again.

579
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:44,423
You what?

580
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,559
That's why I'm doing
all of this.

581
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:51,096
To prove I am still
a good Agent.

582
00:23:51,164 --> 00:23:55,133
Look, I'm sorry about
your little girl.

583
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:56,802
I really am.

584
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:59,237
But it's not possible--

585
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:00,772
please?
You can't--

586
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,642
please?

587
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:07,446
Every day in this world is
a reminder of what I've lost.

588
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,281
My child, my friends, my life.

589
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:10,916
I have no tether here.

590
00:24:10,984 --> 00:24:15,787
The Warehouse is the only home
I have now.

591
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:30,736
Ooh! Whoa!

592
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:33,438
I do miss the horse
and buggy days.

593
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:36,775
Progress is
in many ways overrated.

594
00:24:39,746 --> 00:24:42,781
Whoo!

595
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:44,983
Ahh.

596
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:46,018
Whoo!

597
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:48,487
A grappling hook?

598
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:52,157
I designed it myself.

599
00:24:52,225 --> 00:24:53,525
What?

600
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:55,127
Nothing.

601
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:57,863
It's just a little
old fashioned.

602
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,432
Well, it wasn't when
I invented it.

603
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,135
And it seems
to have saved your life.

604
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:06,204
And yet you're still wondering
if I set this whole thing up

605
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:07,806
just to prove my innocence.

606
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:10,542
Well, the thought did
cross my mind

607
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,412
somewhere between,
"holy crap, I'm gonna die,"

608
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:15,714
and, "oh, I'm flying!"

609
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:18,850
And what have you concluded?

610
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:20,519
The jury's still out.

611
00:25:20,586 --> 00:25:24,589
I suppose if
we work together,

612
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:26,191
it may be faster.

613
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:28,226
And you could keep
an eye on me.

614
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:29,861
Yes.

615
00:25:29,929 --> 00:25:33,765
That thought
crossed my mind too.

616
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,667
You coming?

617
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:40,472
Hey, look what I found.

618
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,040
Tag says it reduces
shyness, so I--

619
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:43,108
ah! Ow, ow!

620
00:25:43,176 --> 00:25:44,609
Artie!

621
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:46,211
Pain.
Lots.

622
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,279
Not good.

623
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:48,880
Never hurt like this before.

624
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:50,582
Well, that's 'cause
the doc always took it out.

625
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,684
Yeah, must still be growing.

626
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:54,753
Might keep growing
till it bursts.

627
00:25:54,821 --> 00:26:00,125
Ow.

628
00:26:00,193 --> 00:26:01,927
You know, this is called
breaking and entering

629
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:03,095
these days.

630
00:26:03,162 --> 00:26:05,764
It always was.

631
00:26:05,832 --> 00:26:08,200
Things haven't changed much.

632
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:10,936
Oh.

633
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:12,304
Uh, why don't you take
the desk?

634
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:13,672
I'll go through the closet.

635
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:19,411
Aye, aye.

636
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:22,347
So you built that gun, huh?

637
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:25,584
You are coveting
my grappler.

638
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:27,185
Old fashioned, indeed.

639
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,054
Admiring maybe.

640
00:26:29,122 --> 00:26:31,089
Not coveting.

641
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:34,192
My technical skill could
come in very handy

642
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:39,131
when I come back to work.

643
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:42,834
Why were you bronzed?

644
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:45,170
The scales
that lady justice holds

645
00:26:45,238 --> 00:26:47,839
are more easily tipped
than one knows.

646
00:26:47,907 --> 00:26:50,375
The world is never
as you think it should be.

647
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:52,878
Well, it's not
my decision anyway.

648
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:54,613
You know, I don't even think
it's Artie's.

649
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,214
Of course.

650
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:57,449
No pressure.

651
00:26:57,517 --> 00:26:58,984
Just making conversation.

652
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:01,820
Pointed conversation,
but nevertheless--

653
00:27:01,888 --> 00:27:03,255
here.

654
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,357
Let me do it.

655
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:07,259
Oh.

656
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:17,702
H.G., come here.
Look at these pictures.

657
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,839
These are all of Phillip,
only he's--

658
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:23,642
quite a bit more
of a roly-poly.

659
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:25,977
Look at the dates
on these files.

660
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:28,847
He did this in three weeks.

661
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:33,318
Something's turning these boys
into perfect specimens.

662
00:27:33,386 --> 00:27:35,554
And then killing them.

663
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:37,255
Just a little farther, Artie.

664
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,423
To this chair.

665
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:39,958
Oh, little help here.

666
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:42,294
At some point, you people
will have to realize

667
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:44,863
that "Veterinarian" means
"animal doctor," not humans.

668
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:46,665
Hey, I don't want
to be here either, so--

669
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:48,166
look, Doc Wellins
is out of town.

670
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:49,634
His appendix is about
to burst,

671
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:51,236
so it's either the vet
or the barber.

672
00:27:51,304 --> 00:27:52,504
An appendectomy?

673
00:27:52,572 --> 00:27:54,172
You do realize that most
of the surgeries

674
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,441
I perform are spaying
and neutering?

675
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,076
Okay, the barber.
The barber.

676
00:27:58,144 --> 00:27:59,477
Oh!
Look, Artie.

677
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:00,845
Please sit down.
Okay.

678
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:03,181
I mean, come on.
Help the guy out.

679
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:05,150
Hey, I can make him look
like a giant walrus,

680
00:28:05,218 --> 00:28:06,685
if that makes it any easier.

681
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:08,453
Artie, I will help you,
if only to take you

682
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:09,588
out of his care.

683
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:10,689
Good idea.
Come on.

684
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:12,023
Let's go to the exam room.

685
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:13,425
Ow!

686
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,660
Hey, croissant-boy,
I need a prep nurse.

687
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:17,062
Get in here.

688
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,064
Okay, but I'm not
shaving anything.

689
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:21,733
More wrestlers
are getting sick.

690
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:25,737
Pretty soon the whole team's
gonna end up extra crispy.

691
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:27,339
That's strange.

692
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:29,074
Why would they
put a padlock

693
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:31,209
on a fridge?

694
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:40,852
"Boiling Point Energy Drink"?

695
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,521
Myka, every time I saw Gary,
he was chugging

696
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:49,160
one of these drinks.

697
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,862
It's the drink.

698
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,231
Claudia, you have to get
to Gary and warn him.

699
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:54,399
On it.

700
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:58,336
The artifact is in the drink.

701
00:29:09,402 --> 00:29:12,471
So Dr. Mahoney, you created
the Boiling Point formula?

702
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:14,139
Yes, and there's nothing
harmful in it.

703
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:17,509
It's vitamins, caffeine,
amino acids.

704
00:29:17,577 --> 00:29:19,078
It's like any other drink
on the market

705
00:29:19,145 --> 00:29:21,213
except that ours is specially
formulated

706
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:22,715
to accelerate muscle growth.

707
00:29:22,782 --> 00:29:24,116
It helps people.

708
00:29:24,184 --> 00:29:25,384
You're testing it
on the wrestling team

709
00:29:25,452 --> 00:29:26,852
at Tamalpais.

710
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,587
There are laws against that.

711
00:29:28,655 --> 00:29:30,255
Nonsense!
It was a focus group.

712
00:29:30,323 --> 00:29:32,024
The kids were getting faster,
stronger--

713
00:29:32,092 --> 00:29:33,392
and combustible.

714
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,160
Boiling Point
financially supports

715
00:29:35,228 --> 00:29:37,596
the team and you
paid Coach Tappon

716
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,731
to get them to drink it.

717
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:41,266
That wasn't my idea!

718
00:29:41,334 --> 00:29:42,401
It was mine.

719
00:29:42,469 --> 00:29:46,405
Jeff Russell.
Welcome, ladies.

720
00:29:46,473 --> 00:29:48,007
Gerald, they're looking
for you in the lab.

721
00:29:48,074 --> 00:29:49,742
Great.

722
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:51,143
On campus,
you pulled Coach Tappon

723
00:29:51,211 --> 00:29:52,978
into a meeting.

724
00:29:53,046 --> 00:29:55,314
Boiling Point is your company.

725
00:29:55,382 --> 00:29:57,416
Founder and CEO, miss?

726
00:29:57,484 --> 00:30:00,019
<i>Agent</i> Bering,
Secret Service.

727
00:30:00,086 --> 00:30:01,286
And you are?

728
00:30:01,354 --> 00:30:04,023
Agent Wells.

729
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,958
Who is also an Agent
under me.

730
00:30:06,026 --> 00:30:08,394
Does whatever I say.

731
00:30:08,461 --> 00:30:11,597
Lots of companies
support school teams

732
00:30:11,665 --> 00:30:13,465
and we owe a lot to this town.

733
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:14,933
And for me,
it was personal.

734
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:16,168
You were on
the wrestling team?

735
00:30:16,236 --> 00:30:19,505
Coach Tappon helped to
focus my life.

736
00:30:19,572 --> 00:30:21,040
I wanted
to give something back.

737
00:30:21,107 --> 00:30:22,241
So what?

738
00:30:22,308 --> 00:30:23,842
So people died.

739
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:26,011
Coach Tappon died.

740
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:28,380
And I'm sad about that.

741
00:30:28,448 --> 00:30:31,417
But I'm still waiting
to hear your proof

742
00:30:31,484 --> 00:30:33,419
that my drink was responsible.

743
00:30:33,486 --> 00:30:36,188
Or you could come with me
and I can prove to you

744
00:30:36,256 --> 00:30:40,359
that it's completely harmless.

745
00:30:40,427 --> 00:30:42,461
Might be a trap.

746
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:44,396
Usually is.

747
00:30:44,464 --> 00:30:47,299
Here's my impression of Pete
at the sight of blood.

748
00:30:49,536 --> 00:30:50,436
No, no, no, no, no.

749
00:30:50,503 --> 00:30:51,704
Yes.

750
00:30:51,771 --> 00:30:53,172
I never sounded like--

751
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:56,308
okay, that's fairly accurate.

752
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:57,743
Just 'cause I was worried
about him.

753
00:30:57,811 --> 00:30:59,712
Oh, right, right.
It's sweet.

754
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:01,513
A little girly, but sweet.

755
00:31:01,581 --> 00:31:02,981
Girly.

756
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:05,084
Artie, we thought you would
recuperate better here,

757
00:31:05,151 --> 00:31:07,019
but you got to promise that
you're gonna try

758
00:31:07,087 --> 00:31:08,187
to get some rest.

759
00:31:08,254 --> 00:31:10,422
Great.
Artie loves resting.

760
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,257
Oh, and he will,

761
00:31:12,325 --> 00:31:13,459
because I'm putting you
in charge.

762
00:31:13,526 --> 00:31:14,493
If he's not up
on his feet

763
00:31:14,561 --> 00:31:16,128
in a couple of days,

764
00:31:16,196 --> 00:31:17,196
I'm coming after you.

765
00:31:17,263 --> 00:31:18,297
You're in charge?

766
00:31:18,364 --> 00:31:19,998
That's right, old boy.

767
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:21,266
I'll go get you some soup.

768
00:31:21,334 --> 00:31:24,203
Okay.

769
00:31:29,209 --> 00:31:30,242
You should ask her out.

770
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,044
Me ask her out?
Yeah.

771
00:31:32,112 --> 00:31:33,445
Right.

772
00:31:33,513 --> 00:31:35,347
Or be one of those
agents obsessed

773
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:36,448
with the Warehouse.

774
00:31:36,516 --> 00:31:37,649
That always works out so well.

775
00:31:37,717 --> 00:31:38,817
You weren't talking to me.

776
00:31:38,885 --> 00:31:40,152
Oh, no?
No.

777
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,453
Oh, well,
who was I talking to?

778
00:31:41,521 --> 00:31:43,322
I don't know.
Let's just see.

779
00:31:43,389 --> 00:31:45,224
When I died in the tunnel,
didn't you think

780
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:48,827
for just an instant,
"poor Artie.

781
00:31:48,895 --> 00:31:53,031
He gave his life to this place
and he died alone"?

782
00:31:53,099 --> 00:31:54,500
Hmm?

783
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:55,868
And since then, I see what's
been happening to you.

784
00:31:55,935 --> 00:31:57,436
What happening?
No happening.

785
00:31:57,504 --> 00:31:59,004
I think you're worried
that you caught

786
00:31:59,072 --> 00:32:01,507
a glimpse
into your own future.

787
00:32:01,574 --> 00:32:04,009
Oh, those painkillers are
making you loopy, old boy.

788
00:32:04,077 --> 00:32:05,811
Oh, no, I'm not
on any painkillers.

789
00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:07,880
And then your stuff
didn't come from home,

790
00:32:07,947 --> 00:32:09,915
so you feel uprooted
and last week,

791
00:32:09,983 --> 00:32:11,650
you imagined reconnecting
to an old girlfriend.

792
00:32:11,718 --> 00:32:14,086
In my defense,
I do have a lot of those dreams.

793
00:32:19,292 --> 00:32:21,126
Yeah.

794
00:32:21,194 --> 00:32:23,128
You don't have to miss out
on having a real life

795
00:32:23,196 --> 00:32:27,533
like I did.

796
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,970
I'd be honored to have
a life like yours.

797
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:35,474
I'd be honored if you'd
try for a little more.

798
00:32:41,681 --> 00:32:44,683
Dude, you look
like Bantha poodoo.

799
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:48,020
Well, as you can see,
I feel fantastic.

800
00:32:48,087 --> 00:32:49,688
Spread the word
to your teammates.

801
00:32:49,756 --> 00:32:51,557
Stop drinking those dumb
energy drinks.

802
00:32:51,624 --> 00:32:52,991
And I need your help.

803
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:54,159
Why?
What's wrong with--

804
00:32:54,227 --> 00:32:55,627
no, just trust me.

805
00:32:55,695 --> 00:32:56,929
The bottling plant,
you said it was closing down.

806
00:32:56,996 --> 00:32:58,664
Why?
I don't know.

807
00:32:58,731 --> 00:33:01,166
It's some kind of deal
to sell it off or something.

808
00:33:01,234 --> 00:33:02,801
Talk to me more about that.

809
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,541
I found some tea.

810
00:33:09,609 --> 00:33:11,343
Why don't you people have soup?
I mean, everybody has soup.

811
00:33:11,411 --> 00:33:12,644
We're weird.

812
00:33:12,712 --> 00:33:14,079
Surgery was fun, huh?

813
00:33:14,147 --> 00:33:15,914
You got some moves
with that knife.

814
00:33:15,982 --> 00:33:17,416
Hey.
Want to get dinner?

815
00:33:17,483 --> 00:33:19,518
Or coffee.

816
00:33:19,586 --> 00:33:21,153
Pastries.

817
00:33:21,221 --> 00:33:22,487
The hardware store
has a candy aisle.

818
00:33:22,555 --> 00:33:23,555
We're not going out.

819
00:33:23,623 --> 00:33:25,157
We could stay inside.

820
00:33:25,225 --> 00:33:27,025
I heard the hardware store
delivers candy.

821
00:33:27,093 --> 00:33:30,996
Look, my ex, it turns out
he's a giant tool box

822
00:33:31,064 --> 00:33:33,265
and I moved to a place
where I couldn't

823
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:34,933
possibly meet
any cute men, so--

824
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:37,102
a-ha!
You think I'm cute.

825
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:40,138
Pete, we're not going out.

826
00:33:40,206 --> 00:33:43,909
Yeah, but you think
I'm cute.

827
00:33:43,977 --> 00:33:46,245
As you can see,
there's nothing dangerous

828
00:33:46,312 --> 00:33:48,180
in the drink.

829
00:33:48,248 --> 00:33:49,781
Well, do you collect
test samples

830
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:50,949
from every batch?

831
00:33:51,017 --> 00:33:52,951
For safety purposes.

832
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:54,953
It's standard practice.
Why?

833
00:33:55,021 --> 00:33:56,355
That ladle.

834
00:33:56,422 --> 00:33:59,191
Is that what your people use
to collect the samples?

835
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:00,959
I suppose.

836
00:34:01,027 --> 00:34:03,295
Myka, do you know
Godfrid's Spoon?

837
00:34:03,363 --> 00:34:04,463
No.

838
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,266
We looked for it
at Warehouse 12.

839
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:10,569
Godfrid Haraldsson,
a Viking Prince.

840
00:34:10,637 --> 00:34:12,271
It's supposedly forged
from the armor

841
00:34:12,338 --> 00:34:13,672
of fallen warriors.

842
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,507
His men would drink
from it before battle.

843
00:34:15,575 --> 00:34:18,510
It gave them strength.

844
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:20,612
What are you talking about?

845
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,947
Mr. Russell,
where did you get this ladle?

846
00:34:22,015 --> 00:34:23,515
I don't know.
It's always been here.

847
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:25,951
Myka, this plant's closing.

848
00:34:26,019 --> 00:34:27,185
Production moves
to Naperville, Illinois,

849
00:34:27,253 --> 00:34:28,553
in three weeks.

850
00:34:28,621 --> 00:34:29,888
What's in Naperville,
Illinois?

851
00:34:29,956 --> 00:34:31,023
Omnico Headquarters.

852
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,291
They're buying Boiling Point.

853
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:33,625
Beaucoup bucks
for the founder.

854
00:34:33,693 --> 00:34:36,495
That gives you motive
to keep the deaths quiet

855
00:34:36,562 --> 00:34:38,397
until the deal goes through
and it's not

856
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,666
your problem anymore.

857
00:34:40,733 --> 00:34:42,267
This belongs to me.

858
00:34:42,335 --> 00:34:44,770
Gerald, what are you doing?

859
00:34:44,837 --> 00:34:45,971
You have no right
to come in here.

860
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:47,406
That ladle touches
every batch

861
00:34:47,473 --> 00:34:48,674
of Boiling Point.

862
00:34:48,741 --> 00:34:50,008
Ruh-roh.

863
00:34:50,076 --> 00:34:51,677
You don't have to answer their
questions, Jeff.

864
00:34:51,744 --> 00:34:53,412
Mr. Russell,
does Dr. Mahoney have stake

865
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:55,547
in your company's
sale to Oomnico?

866
00:34:55,615 --> 00:34:57,950
Gerald's been with Boiling
Point since the beginning.

867
00:34:58,017 --> 00:34:59,351
Jeff--

868
00:34:59,419 --> 00:35:01,086
he must have a fortune
in stock options by now.

869
00:35:01,154 --> 00:35:02,487
Jeff, shut up.

870
00:35:02,555 --> 00:35:05,791
Gerald, for God's sakes,
give them the ladle.

871
00:35:05,858 --> 00:35:08,026
No.
Hey! Hey!

872
00:35:08,094 --> 00:35:09,027
No!
No!

873
00:35:09,095 --> 00:35:10,262
What are you doing?

874
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,565
No, Claudia!

875
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:14,800
Grab Mahoney!

876
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:16,401
Gerald, what have you done?

877
00:35:16,469 --> 00:35:18,036
He's about to tell
us right now.

878
00:35:18,104 --> 00:35:19,304
If Omnico finds
out the drink is flawed,

879
00:35:19,372 --> 00:35:22,407
the sale doesn't go through.

880
00:35:22,475 --> 00:35:23,809
What's gonna happen to her?

881
00:35:23,876 --> 00:35:25,978
The more you take in,
the quicker

882
00:35:26,045 --> 00:35:27,279
it seems to take effect.

883
00:35:27,347 --> 00:35:28,981
And it's seeping directly
into her pores.

884
00:35:29,048 --> 00:35:34,486
I'm afraid she's not
gonna last very long.

885
00:35:34,554 --> 00:35:35,921
I'm sorry.

886
00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:37,422
None of this should
have happened.

887
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,991
The deal should have gone
through weeks ago,

888
00:35:39,058 --> 00:35:40,525
then everything
just got out of hand.

889
00:35:40,593 --> 00:35:41,960
You knew.

890
00:35:42,028 --> 00:35:44,262
You knew what we were putting
out there could--

891
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:46,465
you killed Coach Tappon.

892
00:35:46,532 --> 00:35:49,501
Is it warm in here or am
I wearing 38 snuggies?

893
00:35:49,569 --> 00:35:51,103
Those boys only died because
they drank too much.

894
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,671
It was never safe.

895
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:53,739
You just thought
you could get away

896
00:35:53,806 --> 00:35:54,873
before anyone noticed.

897
00:35:54,941 --> 00:35:56,041
I didn't know how it worked.

898
00:35:56,109 --> 00:35:57,342
How long does she have?

899
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,877
I don't know.
I'm sorry.

900
00:35:58,945 --> 00:36:00,412
Based on how quickly
she's reacting,

901
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,014
I'd guess an hour,
maybe two.

902
00:36:02,081 --> 00:36:03,482
We have to act quickly.

903
00:36:03,549 --> 00:36:04,783
I'm not letting anyone else
get hurt by this.

904
00:36:04,851 --> 00:36:05,984
What do we do?

905
00:36:06,052 --> 00:36:07,519
Amino acids.

906
00:36:07,587 --> 00:36:09,721
The amino acids
may have made contact

907
00:36:09,789 --> 00:36:11,123
with the metal and amped up
the powers

908
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,225
of the original ladle.

909
00:36:13,292 --> 00:36:15,160
I did a lot of research
on the subject

910
00:36:15,228 --> 00:36:16,828
of amino acids
for Dr. Moreau.

911
00:36:16,896 --> 00:36:18,630
Let me have a look.

912
00:36:18,698 --> 00:36:20,198
Perhaps I can cobble
together an antidote.

913
00:36:20,266 --> 00:36:21,833
But that was 115 years ago.

914
00:36:21,901 --> 00:36:24,936
I doubt amino acids have
changed a great deal since then.

915
00:36:25,004 --> 00:36:27,873
Hey!

916
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,475
You're going to take Agent
Wells to your lab

917
00:36:30,543 --> 00:36:33,011
and you are going
to assist her now.

918
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:35,013
I didn't want any of this.

919
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:37,749
Then this is your lucky day,
Gerald.

920
00:36:37,817 --> 00:36:40,118
Because we're giving you
a chance to get it all sorted.

921
00:36:40,186 --> 00:36:42,421
Come on.

922
00:36:42,488 --> 00:36:43,555
Okay, I need something
that slows down

923
00:36:43,623 --> 00:36:44,890
the burning process.

924
00:36:44,957 --> 00:36:46,758
I'll put something together.
Okay.

925
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:55,033
Any change?

926
00:36:55,101 --> 00:36:56,334
No, she's burning up.

927
00:36:56,402 --> 00:36:57,903
I'm fighting a losing battle.

928
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,471
She doesn't have much time.

929
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:01,773
I hope you have something.

930
00:37:01,841 --> 00:37:04,376
I hope so too.

931
00:37:04,444 --> 00:37:07,846
Claudia, I'm afraid this won't
taste very good.

932
00:37:13,853 --> 00:37:17,155
I know one mission won't change
your mind.

933
00:37:17,223 --> 00:37:20,759
I'm not expecting miracles
overnight.

934
00:37:20,827 --> 00:37:22,694
Just keep an open mind.

935
00:37:29,435 --> 00:37:32,637
Hey, you.

936
00:37:32,705 --> 00:37:34,206
How do you feel?

937
00:37:34,273 --> 00:37:35,440
Did I combust?

938
00:37:35,508 --> 00:37:37,175
No.

939
00:37:37,243 --> 00:37:40,145
If that guy made me combust,
I'm gonna be pissed.

940
00:37:40,213 --> 00:37:41,446
Oh, thank God.

941
00:37:41,514 --> 00:37:42,814
Here, let's just set you up.

942
00:37:42,882 --> 00:37:44,883
That's easy for u to say.

943
00:37:44,951 --> 00:37:47,018
Ooh.

944
00:37:47,086 --> 00:37:48,320
Okay?

945
00:37:48,387 --> 00:37:51,590
You should really thank H.G.

946
00:37:51,657 --> 00:37:54,493
She--

947
00:38:03,836 --> 00:38:05,103
U were being wheeled out--

948
00:38:05,171 --> 00:38:06,705
okay, I don't care
if I'm having

949
00:38:06,773 --> 00:38:08,440
a brain transplant!

950
00:38:08,508 --> 00:38:10,475
If you cross paths
with H.G. Wells,

951
00:38:10,543 --> 00:38:13,145
you yank me out
of anesthesia

952
00:38:13,212 --> 00:38:14,246
and you fill me in.

953
00:38:14,314 --> 00:38:15,347
Is that understood?

954
00:38:15,415 --> 00:38:16,782
I'm really glad she showed up.

955
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:18,250
She saved my life.
Mine too.

956
00:38:18,318 --> 00:38:19,952
Yeah, well, MacPherson saved
my life countless times.

957
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:21,753
It didn't change who he was.

958
00:38:21,821 --> 00:38:24,423
Is that understood?

959
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,158
Yes, sir.

960
00:38:26,225 --> 00:38:27,426
Crystal clear.
Ah!

961
00:38:27,493 --> 00:38:28,427
Artie, are you--

962
00:38:28,494 --> 00:38:31,263
whoa, whoa.

963
00:38:31,331 --> 00:38:35,901
Good work on the ladle.

964
00:38:35,969 --> 00:38:37,703
Yeah, yeah.

965
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:40,072
And I think I'm gonna
go to bed.

966
00:38:40,139 --> 00:38:41,807
Apparently falling
into a vat

967
00:38:41,874 --> 00:38:43,942
of bubbling poison kind
of takes it out of you.

968
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,278
Uh, Claudia, wait.
I have something for you.

969
00:38:46,346 --> 00:38:48,347
College admissions
for South Dakota University.

970
00:38:48,414 --> 00:38:50,515
There's some online courses
in there too.

971
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:52,551
So why the parental shove?

972
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:54,786
Well, you need
a college degree

973
00:38:54,854 --> 00:38:57,222
to apply
for the Secret Service.

974
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,191
Right.
Right.

975
00:38:59,258 --> 00:39:00,759
Okay.

976
00:39:00,827 --> 00:39:04,329
Um...Thanks for being
so hard on me out there.

977
00:39:04,397 --> 00:39:07,399
Turns out, you can take it.

978
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,341
So I'm gonna go back
to the Warehouse.

979
00:39:16,409 --> 00:39:17,809
Do you want to come?
No, no, no.

980
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:20,646
I, uh--I got a date
with...

981
00:39:20,713 --> 00:39:22,848
Kelly possibly.

982
00:39:22,915 --> 00:39:24,716
Yeah.

983
00:39:24,784 --> 00:39:27,152
Oh, I thought
she turned you down.

984
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,186
Oh, no, no, no.
She did.

985
00:39:28,254 --> 00:39:29,921
She did.

986
00:39:29,989 --> 00:39:31,256
I just figured,
you know,

987
00:39:31,324 --> 00:39:34,059
sometimes people
can surprise you.

988
00:39:38,865 --> 00:39:42,434
Yeah, I guess sometimes
they do.

989
00:39:45,571 --> 00:39:48,006
♪ ♪

990
00:39:48,074 --> 00:39:52,277
You should be resting.

991
00:39:52,345 --> 00:39:56,515
This is resting for me.

992
00:39:56,582 --> 00:39:58,483
Okay, I rush all the way back
to remove an appendix

993
00:39:58,551 --> 00:40:00,385
from my favorite patient,
but apparently

994
00:40:00,453 --> 00:40:02,020
he did start without me.

995
00:40:02,088 --> 00:40:04,356
Mmm, yeah,
and I'm taking a long time

996
00:40:04,424 --> 00:40:06,124
to recover without you too.

997
00:40:06,192 --> 00:40:07,926
Not if you work
your meridians.

998
00:40:07,994 --> 00:40:08,960
I know.

999
00:40:09,028 --> 00:40:10,128
I'll tap all of the meridians

1000
00:40:10,196 --> 00:40:12,064
and even the ticklish ones.

1001
00:40:12,131 --> 00:40:13,965
You can have the next one.
I promise.

1002
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:16,101
Oh, thank you.
That's--

1003
00:40:16,169 --> 00:40:18,370
I'm honored.

1004
00:40:18,438 --> 00:40:22,307
Well, until next year then.

1005
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:24,109
Vanessa?

1006
00:40:40,993 --> 00:40:43,862
I've been thinking
that, uh,

1007
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:46,798
you know, sometimes...

1008
00:40:46,866 --> 00:40:49,167
I can be kind of obnoxious
in a really fun

1009
00:40:49,235 --> 00:40:53,105
and entertaining way and since
it's already come up,

1010
00:40:53,172 --> 00:40:55,373
you did mention
that I was cute.

1011
00:40:55,441 --> 00:40:57,676
Although now that
I think about it,

1012
00:40:57,744 --> 00:40:59,711
bunny rabbits
and kittens are cute,

1013
00:40:59,779 --> 00:41:02,447
so maybe it wasn't he compliment
that I thought it was.

1014
00:41:07,787 --> 00:41:11,022
Look, I'm just heading
into town.

1015
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:14,826
Do you want to come with me
for a little walk

1016
00:41:14,894 --> 00:41:20,265
or a sit?

1017
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:23,702
Yeah, I'd like that.

1018
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:26,271
Good.

1019
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:27,672
But I'll drive.

1020
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,174
Yeah, you better.

1021
00:41:41,053 --> 00:41:45,991
But here's the thing.

1022
00:41:46,058 --> 00:41:48,560
I like you when
you're not being really

1023
00:41:48,628 --> 00:41:50,162
unnecessarily mean to me.

1024
00:41:50,229 --> 00:41:52,430
And I need to eat,
you know,

1025
00:41:52,498 --> 00:41:56,401
and I figured, I don't know,
your species

1026
00:41:56,469 --> 00:42:01,206
probably occasionally
eats too.

1027
00:42:01,274 --> 00:42:04,910
So maybe the two of us could sit
down at the same table

1028
00:42:04,977 --> 00:42:08,346
together and both eat.

1029
00:42:19,225 --> 00:42:20,892
Fine.

1030
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,129
Eating at the same table...

1031
00:42:24,197 --> 00:42:26,264
But nothing more
and don't get any ideas.

1032
00:42:26,332 --> 00:42:28,133
I almost never do.

1033
00:42:28,201 --> 00:42:30,702
Chinese place on main
and we're going dutch.

1034
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:33,471
Couldn't we go to
the Dutch place on Fifth

1035
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:35,207
and go Chinese?

1036
00:42:35,274 --> 00:42:38,009
Come on, slappy,
before I change my mind.

1037
00:42:38,077 --> 00:42:40,345
Hey, so when you said
I was cute,

1038
00:42:40,413 --> 00:42:42,814
did you mean, like, kitten,
bunny rabbits cute or--
