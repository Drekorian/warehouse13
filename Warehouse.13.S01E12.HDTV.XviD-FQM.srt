that we have competition.

- lattimer and bering,
right?

6
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:15,367
They're so raw, so untrained,
so corruptible.

Put them all over the world,

down to two locations,

you wanted no ice in your le--

You're here because

- two policemen dead, arthur.
i know what happened.

The montreal police have
a dashboard camera in the car.

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,534
- but i told pete.
he had the recording.

79

How did you--?
- please.

- look, we were
following a lead.

- you took a shot
in the dark.

82
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,667
- we hit the center
of that target.

83
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:41,300
- with
a small-caliber bullet.

84
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:44,334
- pete's caliber
is very large. we--

85
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
You know what? i'm done
with this analogy.

86
00:06:46,467 --> 00:06:48,667
- we had an agreement.

87
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:50,467
You were supposed to gather
information...

88
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:51,767
- i know.
- bring it to me...

89
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,400
- yeah.
- and we would plan

To get macpherson
together.

91
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:57,567
You had no offensive
strategy.

92
00:06:57,634 --> 00:07:00,601
No defensive posture.
no containment plan.

93
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:03,334
You were not prepared.

or i swear on the ashes

Of the first 12 warehouses,
i will take them away.

- i can get macpherson again.
- i don't doubt it.

99

You make no moves against him
without consulting me first.

your hunger nerve to death.

- uh, the doctor said
it might be a virus.

you might need the support.

172
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:58,667
- oh, please, warren.

173
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:00,367
- i've got to go down
to the basement.

174
00:12:00,434 --> 00:12:02,434
Eat something!

175
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,200
- i'm not hungry.

176
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:09,834
- well, um, i'm going to get
that guest room ready.

177
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:12,233
And for your bed, i've got
some new flannel sheets

178
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,200
I got at dody's.
no, no, no. you are my guests.

179
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:18,400
It's my house.
you're my guests.

180
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:24,601
- wow.
[laughs]

181
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:25,934
- what about work?

182
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:28,034
- uh, well,
work vanished.

183
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:33,001
And until it reappears,
i'm here as a friend

184
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:35,968
In this hopefully
not too stressful time.

185
00:12:36,034 --> 00:12:39,701
I mean, it could have
been worse, right? your dad?

186
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:43,200
- thank you.

187
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:48,133
No, i-i appreciate it,
and you're right.

188
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,801
It could have been worse.

189
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:52,367
- well, hey, wait, wait.
myka, myka, myka.

190
00:12:52,434 --> 00:12:53,801
- yeah?

191
00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:55,200
- look, i was talking
to your dad.

192
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:57,834
He thinks you're still in d.c.
they both do.

193
00:12:57,901 --> 00:12:59,567
- well, yeah.

194
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:01,467
And if you tell them
any differently, i swear,

195
00:13:01,534 --> 00:13:04,233
I will--i will drop a dictionary
on your crotch.

196
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,467
What? i'm supposed to tell them
that i'm working

197
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:09,068
<i>for the world's most dangerous
antiques roadshow?</i>

198
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:11,133
- no.
you tell them the truth.

199
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,367
Or at least
part of the truth.

200
00:13:12,434 --> 00:13:13,734
I don't know. something
to cut the stress.

201
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:15,434
- i'm not stressed.

202
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,334
- you're lying to them.

203
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,068
- it's a force of habit,
you know?

204
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:22,701
It keeps my dad from being
disappointed.

205
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:26,068
You have hot sauce
all over your face.

206
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:31,068
[eerie whispering]

207
00:13:56,634 --> 00:13:59,434
[eerie whispering]

208
00:14:55,534 --> 00:14:59,100
- [screams]

209
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:05,167
- dad!

210
00:15:07,233 --> 00:15:08,500
Mom?

211
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:10,968
- myka, get back.

212
00:15:11,034 --> 00:15:13,367
- dad?

213
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:14,934
- watch your eyes.

214
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:15,901
- oh!

215
00:15:15,968 --> 00:15:17,634
[electricity crackles]

216
00:15:17,701 --> 00:15:20,167
- warren. warren.

217
00:15:20,233 --> 00:15:24,267
What happened?
- what happened is...

218
00:15:25,268 --> 00:15:26,568
Your dad's got an artifact.

219
00:15:41,184 --> 00:15:42,751
- myka!

220
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,550
Myka! hey!

221
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,450
- where's the notebook?
- it's this way.

222
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:50,784
- myka?
- mom, it's okay.

223
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:51,984
- myka, who is it?
is she--

224
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,584
- this is claudia.
we work with her.

225
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,084
- what's that?
- that is--

226
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:59,084
- claudia, back here.

227
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:00,350
- that's for me.

228
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,851
- no, you wait
just a minute.

229
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:05,317
I want some answers,
myka.

230
00:16:05,383 --> 00:16:07,218
Now, first of all, who is
the man in the little tv?

231
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:08,484
- his name is artie.

232
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,084
- and is he a doctor?
- no, but--

233
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:11,617
- your father belongs
in a hospital.

234
00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:14,684
- this isn't medical. mom,
this is something else.

235
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:16,650
- and how do you know?
you're not a doctor.

236
00:16:16,717 --> 00:16:18,051
You protect the president.

237
00:16:18,118 --> 00:16:21,550
- not anymore.

238
00:16:21,617 --> 00:16:26,118
I'm still with the government,
but i am doing this now.

239
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:30,350
- what?
what are you doing?

240
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:38,084
- i'm trying to help dad, mom,
so just let me do that.

241
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:42,684
Trust me.
please.

242
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:51,884
- ready?
- yeah.

243
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:53,784
Um, mom, just stay here.

244
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:56,650
Whatever you see or hear,
just stay put.

245
00:16:56,717 --> 00:17:00,218
- but--
- just don't move.

246
00:17:00,283 --> 00:17:02,717
- do--

247
00:17:02,784 --> 00:17:05,184
- it'll be okay.

248
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,751
They do this kind of stuff
all the time, so--

249
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:09,584
- claudia?
- i gotta--

250
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:13,250
- but what's going on?

251
00:17:13,317 --> 00:17:15,084
- they're really good
at this.

252
00:17:17,084 --> 00:17:19,283
- [groans]

253
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,250
- here it is.

254
00:17:26,017 --> 00:17:27,550
- kill it.

255
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:31,984
- duck and cover.

256
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:36,751
- what's happening?

257
00:17:36,817 --> 00:17:38,417
- mom, how's dad?

258
00:17:38,484 --> 00:17:43,017
- um, he's the same.

259
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:44,383
Why, was something
supposed to happen?

260
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:50,417
- check his arms.

261
00:17:50,484 --> 00:17:52,118
- it's still there.

262
00:17:56,851 --> 00:18:00,784
- it's ink.
ink.

263
00:18:00,851 --> 00:18:01,684
Take it out.

264
00:18:11,118 --> 00:18:13,851
- now what?

265
00:18:13,917 --> 00:18:15,617
- the neutralizer failed

266
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:17,884
Because i think we're dealing
with a bifurcated object.

267
00:18:17,951 --> 00:18:19,851
It's--it's got
at least two parts,

268
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:22,317
And they're each dependent
on the other.

269
00:18:22,383 --> 00:18:27,684
And, uh, that notebook is just
one half of the package.

270
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:29,084
- so what's the other half?

271
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:31,151
- you know, based on
the manifestations of the ink,

272
00:18:31,218 --> 00:18:33,084
Then that would tell me that
it's a pen,

273
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:34,917
Most like--well, a pen,
anyway.

274
00:18:34,984 --> 00:18:36,917
Oh, by the way,
the shipper's address?

275
00:18:36,984 --> 00:18:39,017
That's completely phony.

276
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,517
- macpherson sent it,
didn't he?

277
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:44,250
- [sighs]
i don't know that.

278
00:18:44,317 --> 00:18:45,951
- so what?
he's coming after family now?

279
00:18:46,017 --> 00:18:47,884
- what does he want?
- well, he wants to hurt us,

280
00:18:47,951 --> 00:18:50,350
Because we're going after him.
- stop, stop, stop, stop.

281
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:53,450
Just stop it. we don't know
who sent it or why.

282
00:18:53,517 --> 00:18:56,118
If it is macpherson,
it could be revenge or mischief

283
00:18:56,184 --> 00:18:57,751
Or a diversion
so that we're doing this

284
00:18:57,817 --> 00:18:59,751
While he's doing
something else.

285
00:18:59,817 --> 00:19:02,484
Just in case,
just to be safe, i've, uh--

286
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:07,118
I'm circling the wagons
around joshua

287
00:19:07,184 --> 00:19:08,317
And around pete's family.

288
00:19:08,383 --> 00:19:10,517
Who or why does not matter.

289
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:12,617
What matters is your father
and the notebook.

290
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:14,283
Now--now, listen.

291
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,751
I've analyzed the text.
it ain't good. it's poe.

292
00:19:18,817 --> 00:19:22,317
Um, edgar allan poe.

293
00:19:22,383 --> 00:19:25,383
The reason that the book is
getting under your father's skin

294
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,617
Is because the pen
is not with it.

295
00:19:27,684 --> 00:19:29,951
- so, what? we bring the pen
together with the notebook

296
00:19:30,017 --> 00:19:32,250
And this all stops?
- yeah.

297
00:19:32,317 --> 00:19:34,350
Well, probably,

298
00:19:34,417 --> 00:19:37,617
If it follows a typical
bifurcated artifact scenario.

299
00:19:37,684 --> 00:19:39,484
It can't be an accident

300
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,517
That this book found its way
to your dad.

301
00:19:41,584 --> 00:19:47,684
Look, uh, myka, right now
your father is a conduit.

302
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:49,851
The notebook, the pen, they're
linked through his energy,

303
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:52,751
Through his love
of the written word.

304
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,650
- so where is this pen?

305
00:19:54,717 --> 00:19:57,784
- well, i'm searching for
coinciding incidents right now.

306
00:19:57,851 --> 00:19:59,417
Uh, you know, i've got
the filters off.

307
00:19:59,484 --> 00:20:01,184
- but it's causing trouble
somewhere?

308
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,650
- but i'll find it.
you'll get it.

309
00:20:02,717 --> 00:20:04,884
The next time he has an attack,
i'll trace the pen.

310
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:06,751
You'll retrieve it and reunite
it with the notebook.

311
00:20:06,817 --> 00:20:08,184
- how long does he have?

312
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,917
- i don't know what you--
how long--what?

313
00:20:09,984 --> 00:20:11,450
- how long does he have?

314
00:20:11,517 --> 00:20:14,218
Artie, my father can't
take this much longer.

315
00:20:14,283 --> 00:20:17,417
- um...

316
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:19,517
[stutters]

317
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:22,084
A day.
maybe two.

318
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:24,017
But you can help him.

319
00:20:24,084 --> 00:20:25,717
Until i land on something,
myka,

320
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:30,017
Just surround him with
his books, with his world,

321
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:33,484
And read to him, myka,
read to him books that he loves

322
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,417
And use those words to fight
what's happening to him.

323
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:41,684
And just try to keep him
connected to reality if you can.

324
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:52,550
- bobby's not that bad.

325
00:20:52,617 --> 00:20:54,917
- look, all i'm saying is,
watch out.

326
00:20:54,984 --> 00:20:56,317
[both laugh]

327
00:20:56,383 --> 00:20:59,584
Geek love. ugh!

328
00:21:04,884 --> 00:21:08,317
- "i might have been improved
for my whole life.

329
00:21:08,383 --> 00:21:11,684
"i might have been made
another creature, perhaps,

330
00:21:11,751 --> 00:21:16,383
For life, by a kind word,
at that season..."

331
00:21:20,984 --> 00:21:22,484
- do you
want me to take over?

332
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,884
- no, no.
i'm--i'm fine.

333
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:32,517
He's gonna be okay, mom.

334
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:33,717
- um...

335
00:21:33,784 --> 00:21:35,584
Oh.

336
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,218
I'll be back in a sec.

337
00:21:37,283 --> 00:21:40,484
I'm just gonna
take these dishes.

338
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,884
- freak's probably
swiped your panties

339
00:21:42,951 --> 00:21:44,917
From gym class
or something.

340
00:21:44,984 --> 00:21:46,283
- gross!

341
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,151
- tiger.

342
00:21:51,218 --> 00:21:52,250
- dad?

343
00:21:52,317 --> 00:21:54,917
- tiger, stop it.

344
00:21:56,317 --> 00:21:59,383
- fire.
- dad?

345
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,751
- fire!

346
00:22:00,817 --> 00:22:02,984
[all screaming]

347
00:22:03,051 --> 00:22:04,017
- dad?

348
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:05,317
[screaming]

349
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:11,918
Help, somebody get some help.

350
00:22:20,184 --> 00:22:22,717
- artie's got something.
- what?

351
00:22:22,783 --> 00:22:25,817
- at the precise moment
your dad was shouting "fire,"

352
00:22:25,884 --> 00:22:27,850
A kid in portland, oregon,
was burned

353
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:31,251
By some bizarre wall of flame
shooting from his locker.

354
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:33,817
No one can explain it.

355
00:22:33,884 --> 00:22:36,117
- well, what about
the tiger thing?

356
00:22:36,184 --> 00:22:39,417
- kid's a football star
for the kingford tigers.

357
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:41,117
- let's go.
- wait, myka.

358
00:22:41,184 --> 00:22:44,151
I need you to stay here.

359
00:22:44,217 --> 00:22:46,584
- i have to help my dad,
pete.

360
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:49,451
- i know, but we've got
two artifacts.

361
00:22:49,518 --> 00:22:50,817
He's connected to one.

362
00:22:50,884 --> 00:22:52,184
I need you to stay
on the notebook.

363
00:22:52,251 --> 00:22:54,783
I'll take care of the pen.

364
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,251
Myka, look at me.

365
00:23:01,084 --> 00:23:04,251
No one can help your dad
right now more than you can.

366
00:23:04,317 --> 00:23:06,317
- i can't let you
go alone.

367
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:10,950
- i'll take claudia.

368
00:23:11,017 --> 00:23:12,917
- keep her safe.

369
00:23:12,984 --> 00:23:14,251
- yeah.

370
00:23:14,317 --> 00:23:16,417
But there's something else.

371
00:23:16,484 --> 00:23:19,551
- what?

372
00:23:19,618 --> 00:23:21,717
- i think i'm hot
for your mom.

373
00:23:28,217 --> 00:23:30,117
- i'll break it to dad.

374
00:23:30,184 --> 00:23:32,484
- okay.

375
00:23:32,551 --> 00:23:35,317
- i needed to speak
with you, bobby.

376
00:23:35,384 --> 00:23:37,484
Is, uh--
is everything okay?

377
00:23:37,551 --> 00:23:39,351
The poetry inspiring you?

378
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,417
- not so much.

379
00:23:42,484 --> 00:23:44,184
- you know, it seems

380
00:23:44,251 --> 00:23:48,084
We had a little burglary here
the other day.

381
00:23:48,151 --> 00:23:52,084
The story is that
it was one of the pens

382
00:23:52,151 --> 00:23:53,618
That edgar allan poe used.

383
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:58,817
- oh, he used it.

384
00:23:58,884 --> 00:24:00,717
Don't look at me
like that.

385
00:24:03,783 --> 00:24:08,884
- i noticed that you were
fascinated with the pen.

386
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,783
- are you saying
i took it?

387
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,217
Are you saying i took it?

388
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:15,351
- i'll tell you what.

389
00:24:15,417 --> 00:24:17,650
I'm gonna go to the lounge
for a soda,

390
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:21,317
And if the pen
should show up while i'm gone,

391
00:24:21,384 --> 00:24:23,683
Well, we'll just chalk it up

392
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,850
To something strange
and mysterious.

393
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:30,884
Back in a bit.

394
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:35,417
- mr. ives.
mr. ives.

395
00:24:35,484 --> 00:24:37,618
Here.

396
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:45,783
- "wall"?

397
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,084
"wall"?
"wall" what?

398
00:24:48,151 --> 00:24:49,284
- you.

399
00:24:49,351 --> 00:24:52,551
[eerie whispering]

400
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:55,351
- [screaming]

401
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:57,950
- [moaning]

402
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,984
- really?
does he like horror novels?

403
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,451
Stephen king,
lovecraft, poe?

404
00:25:21,518 --> 00:25:25,017
- you're assuming the boy reads.
no, he's just a bully.

405
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:27,050
Look, i mean, how big
a deal is this?

406
00:25:27,117 --> 00:25:29,284
I mean, this school's got
a reputation to maintain,

407
00:25:29,351 --> 00:25:30,950
And if it gets out

408
00:25:31,017 --> 00:25:33,417
That the government's
investigating a teenage prank,

409
00:25:33,484 --> 00:25:34,683
It'll put a lot
of parents off.

410
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,317
- you mean donors?

411
00:25:36,384 --> 00:25:37,817
- why do you think
it's just a prank?

412
00:25:37,884 --> 00:25:39,817
- well, we're not schooling
little terrorists here.

413
00:25:39,884 --> 00:25:42,417
Somebody in the science class
got tired

414
00:25:42,484 --> 00:25:44,618
Of parmut picking on him
and gave him a hotfoot.

415
00:25:44,683 --> 00:25:46,417
- oh, yeah?
how's he doing?

416
00:25:46,484 --> 00:25:48,917
- he's fine.
uh, you want this open?

417
00:25:48,984 --> 00:25:53,783
- no. we'll, uh,
we'll take it from here.

418
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,217
- you'll want to step back,
please.

419
00:25:55,284 --> 00:25:56,551
- why?
it's not dangerous.

420
00:25:56,618 --> 00:25:58,984
- please.

421
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:02,551
Thank you.

422
00:26:06,451 --> 00:26:10,518
Okay.
you ready?

423
00:26:10,584 --> 00:26:11,884
- why not?

424
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:20,251
- okay, we're in business.
here we go.

425
00:26:20,317 --> 00:26:24,084
So, uh, you had
any other incidents?

426
00:26:24,151 --> 00:26:25,084
- with what, fire?

427
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:27,950
- well, anything strange.

428
00:26:28,017 --> 00:26:30,317
Say a tell-tale heart,
perhaps?

429
00:26:30,384 --> 00:26:32,217
- what?

430
00:26:35,551 --> 00:26:37,884
- there you go.
- gotta love artie.

431
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:40,284
- what's that?
- you don't happen to have

432
00:26:40,351 --> 00:26:42,417
Edgar allan poe's pen
lying around, would you?

433
00:26:42,484 --> 00:26:45,584
- well, actually--
- yes?

434
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:47,484
- mr. ives' classroom.

435
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:49,284
He likes to collect items
from famous people.

436
00:26:49,351 --> 00:26:51,117
- the pen is here, then.

437
00:26:51,184 --> 00:26:54,417
- well, it was.
um, it got stolen.

438
00:26:57,351 --> 00:27:01,151
- [murmurs]

439
00:27:01,217 --> 00:27:04,584
- this last one
was the worst.

440
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,451
- i know.

441
00:27:13,217 --> 00:27:14,917
- [murmuring]

442
00:27:21,783 --> 00:27:25,518
- dad?

443
00:27:25,584 --> 00:27:30,050
- if you'd been a boy
i'd have called you sue.

444
00:27:30,117 --> 00:27:31,351
- what?

445
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,683
- johnny cash.
it's a song.

446
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,618
<i>a boy named sue.</i>

447
00:27:36,683 --> 00:27:38,451
- okay.

448
00:27:38,518 --> 00:27:42,017
- make you tough.

449
00:27:42,084 --> 00:27:47,584
- well, i'm sorry
i wasn't a boy.

450
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:50,317
- i'm sorry
i wasn't a father.

451
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,484
[groans]

452
00:28:01,717 --> 00:28:03,650
- he has regrets.

453
00:28:09,484 --> 00:28:12,017
- about me?

454
00:28:12,084 --> 00:28:14,017
- yes.

455
00:28:14,084 --> 00:28:15,950
About his life.

456
00:28:16,017 --> 00:28:18,850
- what do you mean?

457
00:28:18,917 --> 00:28:20,817
- he wanted to write books.

458
00:28:20,884 --> 00:28:25,884
- i know. i know that
he wanted to write books.

459
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,984
- did you know
he wrote a novel?

460
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,417
- no.

461
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:35,618
- 12 times.
over and over again.

462
00:28:35,683 --> 00:28:37,850
Unpublished.

463
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:40,984
He loved it too much
to let it go.

464
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:45,017
He was afraid.

465
00:28:45,084 --> 00:28:47,184
- where is it?

466
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:49,717
- a long time ago,
when he finally gave up...

467
00:28:49,783 --> 00:28:55,451
[exhales]
he told me to burn it.

468
00:28:55,518 --> 00:28:58,783
He hasn't written a thing
since.

469
00:29:02,417 --> 00:29:03,717
- [moans]

470
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,718
It can't be.

471
00:29:23,184 --> 00:29:24,650
- mr. ives?

472
00:29:24,717 --> 00:29:27,684
Hello?

473
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:32,284
- nice place for a pen,
soaking up all that poe juice.

474
00:29:32,351 --> 00:29:33,650
- huh.

475
00:29:33,717 --> 00:29:35,151
- do you know that ravens
are actually brilliant?

476
00:29:35,217 --> 00:29:37,517
They've adapted to humans
like rats and cockroaches.

477
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:39,051
They've figured out how to
figure us out.

478
00:29:39,117 --> 00:29:40,850
- shh.
- what?

479
00:29:41,984 --> 00:29:43,817
- shh.

480
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:47,384
Hear anything?

481
00:29:47,483 --> 00:29:49,384
- just the beating
of my hideous--

482
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:50,717
- stop it.
- okay.

483
00:29:54,817 --> 00:29:55,784
- listen.

00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:58,684
[faint scratching]

485
00:30:05,817 --> 00:30:07,051
What is that?

486
00:30:07,117 --> 00:30:08,884
- a rat in the wall?

487
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,917
- short story.
- guy walled up.

505
00:31:30,418 --> 00:31:34,251
- a poem.
i wrote it for you.

506
00:31:34,318 --> 00:31:35,550
- i gotta go.

507
00:31:38,384 --> 00:31:39,318
- [groans]

508
00:31:39,384 --> 00:31:40,917
- we're losing him.

509
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:43,017
- myka, just read to him.

510
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:45,084

- [anguished cry]

514
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:55,884
- you have to find the words
that he loves.

515
00:31:55,951 --> 00:31:58,750
You have to find a book
that means more to him

516
00:31:58,817 --> 00:32:02,384
Than--than anything
in the world.

517
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,251
- mom, tell me
you didn't burn it.

518
00:32:04,318 --> 00:32:06,384
- what?
- dad's book.

519
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:09,750
- aunt cindy's bureau.
the bottom drawer.

520
00:32:11,483 --> 00:32:12,750
- okay,
so ives said that--

521
00:32:12,817 --> 00:32:15,117
That bobby had a crush
on what--what's her name?

522
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:16,650
- tamara.
- tamara, right.

523
00:32:16,717 --> 00:32:18,184
There's always a girl.

524
00:32:18,251 --> 00:32:20,418
- don't blame her.
blame testosterone.

525
00:32:20,483 --> 00:32:22,318
Crazy, crazy man hormone.

526
00:32:22,384 --> 00:32:26,617
- i'm not blaming the girl.
i'm blaming poe.

527
00:32:26,684 --> 00:32:28,517
Bobby?

00:32:43,617 --> 00:32:48,583
Bobby...and...

534
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,318

535
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:54,217
[clears throat]

536
00:32:54,284 --> 00:32:56,450
That's a nice pen,
bobby.

537
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:59,917
Why don't you give it up,
huh?

538
00:32:59,984 --> 00:33:02,617
Come on, give it here.

539
00:33:05,051 --> 00:33:07,550
- "pendulum"?

540
00:33:15,483 --> 00:33:18,217
- you've gotta be kidding me.

541
00:33:18,284 --> 00:33:19,251
- [gasps]

542
00:33:23,184 --> 00:33:25,017
- bobby!

543
00:33:31,617 --> 00:33:33,251

544
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,750
- bobby, you've got to
stop this.

545
00:33:37,817 --> 00:33:39,217
I know,
you're all full of poe,

546
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:41,817
Up to your creepy eyeballs
in "nevermore" and crap, but--

547
00:33:41,884 --> 00:33:44,450
- but--but--but
this isn't fiction!

548
00:33:44,517 --> 00:33:46,017
It's real!

549
00:33:46,084 --> 00:33:49,717
- it's the most real i have
ever felt in my entire life.

550
00:33:49,784 --> 00:33:52,017
<i>- the blue willow sky

"when the girl was born,
his first thought was fear."

553
00:33:58,051 --> 00:33:59,884
- it's beautiful.

554
00:33:59,951 --> 00:34:01,550
- bobby, you're a good person,
but you're--

555
00:34:01,617 --> 00:34:03,583
You're hurting people!

556
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,017
You're hurting yourself
and you're hurting tamara,

557
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,384
And it has to stop!

558
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:09,318
- people like you
don't see me.

559
00:34:09,384 --> 00:34:11,217
You don't believe in me.

560
00:34:11,284 --> 00:34:13,951
People like you need to be
shocked into seeing.

561
00:34:14,017 --> 00:34:17,184
You need to be horrified.
then you'll understand.

562
00:34:17,251 --> 00:34:19,684
- understand what, bobby?
tell me what!

563
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:22,217
- that words have power.

564
00:34:22,284 --> 00:34:25,450
- "...for her.
for his daughter.

565
00:34:25,517 --> 00:34:27,151
She was his life."

567
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,051
It's real!

- it's working, myka.

573
00:34:48,617 --> 00:34:51,418
[echoing]
- words have power.

574
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,184
- something's happening.

575
00:35:09,384 --> 00:35:13,517
Go, go, claudia!
get the pen!

576
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,184
- who are you? what?

577
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,517
- one second. nice, claud.
- here's the bag.

578
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:32,284
- get him to a hospital.
this still has a hold on him!

579
00:35:32,285 --> 00:35:33,685
And Micah's dad.

580
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:44,450

581
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,550
- how is he?

582
00:35:45,617 --> 00:35:46,650
- is that it?
- that's it.

583
00:35:46,717 --> 00:35:47,984
- well, he--he's not worse,

584
00:35:48,051 --> 00:35:50,417
But he's not better.
not--not completely.

585
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:52,884
- his strength
is the only thing

586
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:55,084
That's keeping that pen from
flipping completely out.

587
00:35:55,151 --> 00:35:57,817
- okay, the notebook's
in place.

588
00:35:57,884 --> 00:35:59,584
- good. take the pen,
keep it in the bag,

589
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:02,884
And just, you know,
approach the notebook.

590
00:36:02,951 --> 00:36:05,084
- i'm on it.
- be careful!

591
00:36:05,151 --> 00:36:07,951
- i am! would you stop
yelling at me?

592
00:36:08,017 --> 00:36:10,617
Somebody turn down his volume
or something.

593
00:36:10,684 --> 00:36:12,450
- okay. now what?

594
00:36:12,517 --> 00:36:14,650
- you know, put the bag
right over the notebook,

595
00:36:14,717 --> 00:36:16,218
Turn it upside down,
dump the pen out,

596
00:36:16,284 --> 00:36:18,450
Make sure it lands on the
notebook and stays there.

597
00:36:18,517 --> 00:36:20,251
- that's it?
just dump it out?

598
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:22,617
- yeah.
- just lay it on the notebook?

599
00:36:22,684 --> 00:36:24,051
- yeah.
this isn't cirque du soleil!

600
00:36:24,117 --> 00:36:25,684
Just dump the pen on the book
and stand back!

601
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,884
- all right!

602
00:36:34,717 --> 00:36:36,517
- artie,
nothing's happening.

603
00:36:36,584 --> 00:36:39,251
- uh, that's--that's okay.
it's all right, it's fine.

604
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:41,517
It's been a while
since they've been together.

605
00:36:41,584 --> 00:36:44,917
Probably they're just
getting reacquainted.

[electrical buzzing]

607
00:36:48,218 --> 00:36:49,884

615
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:33,151
- um, sort of.

616
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:37,517
- i was dreaming
you were reading and...

617
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,951
You didn't burn it?

618
00:37:48,017 --> 00:37:50,617
- no.

619

00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,684
Hey, i don't know what it is
you do for a living,

625
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:12,784
But you do it very well,
and i mean that.

626
00:38:18,584 --> 00:38:21,151
I'll see you soon,
and we'll--we'll talk.

627
00:38:23,184 --> 00:38:25,817
We'll talk about something
other than books.

628
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,917
- oh, mom.

629
00:38:31,984 --> 00:38:35,084
- good-bye, honey.

630
00:38:35,151 --> 00:38:38,817

00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:42,251
- i always do.

632
00:38:50,151 --> 00:38:52,517

- called the cab? n--

635
00:39:02,684 --> 00:39:04,984
- no, no. no, i didn't.
- oh.

636
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:10,218
- i think, mr. poe,
that when your things arrive,

637
00:39:10,284 --> 00:39:14,650
We'll stick them in--yeah.
the madrid section.

638
00:39:14,717 --> 00:39:16,450
That is if leena agrees.

639
00:39:16,517 --> 00:39:19,951
- arthur?

640
00:39:20,017 --> 00:39:22,750
Pete and myka
are in colorado springs.

641
00:39:22,817 --> 00:39:24,784
- yeah, i know.
i should have tried--

642
00:39:24,851 --> 00:39:26,151
- and so is macpherson.

643
00:39:26,218 --> 00:39:27,717
[computer beeps]

644
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:31,984
- what?
how did he--

645
00:39:32,051 --> 00:39:34,218
He was there
the whole time?

646
00:39:34,284 --> 00:39:36,951
- he had us all distracted.

647
00:39:37,017 --> 00:39:41,184
I think that was
macpherson's intent.

648
00:39:41,251 --> 00:39:42,151
[farnsworth buzzing]

649
00:39:42,218 --> 00:39:45,984
- ooh.

650
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:47,584
I'll take the farnsworth.

- what?

658
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:13,218
Is this poe? are we back
into the poe thing again?

659
00:40:13,284 --> 00:40:15,851
- i don't know.

660
00:40:38,817 --> 00:40:41,817
- you two are good.

661
00:40:41,884 --> 00:40:44,184
I see why mrs. frederic
drafted you.

662
00:40:48,084 --> 00:40:53,650
- ah-ah! i kill this, and it's
lights out for mom and dad.

663
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:54,984
- you hurt my father.

664
00:40:55,051 --> 00:40:56,350
- he glimpsed the mind

665
00:40:56,417 --> 00:40:57,517
Of one of the greatest authors
in the world.

666
00:40:57,584 --> 00:40:58,951
He'll thank me later.

667
00:40:59,017 --> 00:41:01,951
- oh, you'll be dead later.
- what do you want?

668
00:41:02,017 --> 00:41:05,184
- i want what you risked
your lives to get.

669
00:41:05,251 --> 00:41:09,817
I would have done it myself,
but i lacked the means.

670
00:41:11,884 --> 00:41:13,584
You have
until the count of one.

671
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,483
- you came after family.

672
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,851
- arthur started it.

673
00:41:16,917 --> 00:41:18,383
- what is that
supposed to mean?

674
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:20,851
- ask him.

675
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,350
- pete.

676
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,483
Now let them go.

677
00:41:44,051 --> 00:41:45,017
Do it!

678
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:50,984
- thank you.

679
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:54,717
- consider it a loan.

- what the hell was that?

682
00:42:03,017 --> 00:42:05,184
- jack the ripper's
lantern.

683
00:42:05,251 --> 00:42:08,383
